However, measurements of soil water dynamics in subtropical forests have mostly been restricted to the upper 100 cm of soil. The relative shallow depth in soil water measurement would bias the understanding how and to what extent soil water contributes to evapotranspiration. We investigated and compared the soil water dynamics down to 200 cm depth over 7 years in four subtropical plantations, including one mixed stand type (Cunninghamia lanceolata mixed with Schima superba) and three pure stand types (C. lanceolata, Pinus elliottii, and Pinus massoniana). We also examined the variations in fine root distribution and tree basal area increment across stand types. We showed that, in contrast to the P. elliottii and P. massoniana stands, the C. lanceolata stand type extracted deep soil water when the top soil was still wet, depleted soil water over a longer season, but consumed less total soil water during the dry season. Our results revealed that the mixed stand type depleted more soil water during the dry season than the pure C lanceolata stand type. In addition to the species-specific traits of water consumption, the different soil water depletion between stand types seems to be also accounted for by the different slope aspect and rock fragment content. During the entire dry season, the four stand types mainly relied on the soil water in the 100-200 cm soil depth where fine root density was considerably low, however, the inter annual variation in stem growth depended on the soil water depletion from 0 to 50 cm soil layer. We conclude from these results that deep soil water is likely to make a significant contribution to drought avoidance over the dry period, but the available of shallow soil water to the fine roots during dry season may determine how well trees grow. This study highlights the important to consider the deep soil water extraction when explain the ecosystem evapotranspiration variations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Model-Data Fusion (MDF) or data assimilation methods are useful tools in improving ecosystem models that describe interactions between vegetation and atmosphere. We use a MDF method based on a Bayesian approach, in which data are combined with a process model in order to provide optimized estimates of model parameters and to better quantify model uncertainties, whilst taking into account prior information on the parameters. With this method we are able to use multiple data streams, which allows us to simultaneously constrain modeled variables at site level across different temporal scales. In this study both high frequency eddy covariance flux measurements of net CO2 and evapotranspiration (ET), and low frequency biometric measurements of total aboveground biomass and the annual increment (which includes all compartments), are assimilated with the ORCHIDEE model version ""AR5"" at a beech (Hesse) and a maritime pine (Le Bray) forest site using four to five years of flux data and nine years of biomass data. When assimilating the observed aboveground annual biomass increment (AGB_inc) together with net CO2 and ET flux, the RMSE of modelled AGBinc was reduced from the a priori estimates by 37% at Hesse and 69% at Le Bray, without reducing the fit to the net CO2 and ET that can be achieved when assimilating flux data alone. Assimilating biomass increment data also provides insight in the performance of the allocation scheme of the model. Comparison with detailed site-based measurements at Hesse showed that the optimization reduced positive biases in the model, for example in fine root and leaf production. We also investigated how to use stand-scale total aboveground biomass in optimization (AGB_tot). However, this study demonstrated that assimilating AGB_tot measurements in the ORCHIDEE-AR5 model lead to some inconsistencies, particularly for the annual dynamics of the AGB_inc, partly because this version of the model lacked a realistic representation of forest stand processes including management and disturbances.

Earlier studies have focused on determining the net exchange of VOCs from the forest floor. This study goes one step further, with the aim of separately determining whether the photosynthesized carbon allocation to soil affects the isoprenoid production by different soil organisms, i.e., decomposers, mycorrhizal fungi, and roots. In each treatment, photosynthesized carbon allocation through roots for decomposers and mycorrhizal fungi was controlled by either preventing root ingrowth (50 mu m mesh size) or the ingrowth of roots and fungi (1 mu m mesh) into the soil volume, which is called the trenching approach. Isoprenoid fluxes were measured using dynamic (steady-state flow-through) chambers from the different treatments. This study aimed to analyze how important the understorey vegetation is as a VOC sink. Finally, a statistical model was constructed based on prevailing temperature, seasonality, trenching treatments, understory vegetation cover, above canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil water content, and soil temperature to estimate isoprenoid fluxes. The final model included parameters with a statistically significant effect on the isoprenoid fluxes. The results show that the boreal forest floor emits monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and isoprene. Monoterpenes were the most common group of emitted isoprenoids, and the average flux from the non-trenched forest floor was 23 mu gm(-2) h(-1). The results also show that different biological factors, including litterfall, carbon availability, biological activity in the soil, and physico-chemical processes, such as volatilization and absorption to the surfaces, are important at various times of the year. This study also discovered that understorey vegetation is a strong sink of monoterpenes. The statistical model, based on prevailing temperature, seasonality, vegetation effect, and the interaction of these parameters, explained 43% of the monoterpene fluxes, and 34-46% of individual alpha pinene, camphene, beta-pinene, and Delta(3)-carene fluxes.","[Maki, Mari; Back, Jaana] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Heinonsalo, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Dept Food & Environm Sci, POB 66, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hellen, Heidi] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland","Maki, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mari.maki@helsinki.fi,"Back, Jaana K/A-7405-2010; Hellen, Heidi/J-5313-2014","Back, Jaana K/0000-0002-6107-667X; Hellen, Heidi/0000-0001-7022-3857; Heinonsalo, Jussi/0000-0001-8516-1388; Maki, Mari/0000-0002-9498-2476","Academy of Finland Center of Excellence programmeAcademy of Finland [272041]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [275608, 263858, 292699]","This research was founded by the Academy of Finland Center of Excellence programme (grant no. 272041) and by the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation.

How this process affects soil microbial communities is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to assess the effects of shrub encroachment on soil microbial biomass, abundance and composition by comparing data between shrub patches and neighboring herb patches in shrub-encroached grasslands (SEGs) in Inner Mongolia, China. Fourteen SEG sites from two ecosystem types (typical and desert grasslands) were investigated. The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method was used to analyze the composition and biomass of the soil microbial community. Our results showed that the top-soil microbial biomass and abundances of gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and actinomycetes were significantly higher in shrub patches than in herb patches in both typical and desert grasslands (P < 0.05). The fungi to ""bacteria ratio was significantly higher in shrub patches than in herb patches in desert grassland (P < 0.05). The microbial biomass was positively associated with mean annual precipitation, total nitrogen and available phosphorus, and negatively associated with mean annual ""temperature. Our results also indicated that the variation in microbial composition was largely explained by edaphic factors, followed by climate factors. In conclusion, shrub encroachment in Inner Mongolia grasslands has significantly influenced the structure and abundance of soil microbial communities, which makes the microbial communities toward a fresh organic carbon-based structure. This study highlights the importance of edaphic and climate factors in microbial community shifts in SEGs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Foliar endophytes of grasses exert multiple effects on host rhizosphere with potential consequences on plant-soil feedback. Here, we hypothesize that the grass-endophyte symbiosis impairs soil symbiotic potential, and in turn influences legume performance and nitrogen acquisition. Methods Soil was conditioned in pots, growing Lolium multiflorum with or without the fungal endophyte Epichloe and with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Then, Trifolium repens grew in all types of conditioned soils with high or low rhizobia availability. Results Endophyte soil conditioning reduced AMF spores number and rhizobial nodules (-27 % and -38 %, respectively). Seedling survival was lower in endophyte-conditioned soil and higher in mycorrhizal soils (-27 % and +24 %, respectively). High rhizobia-availability allowed greater growth and nitrogen acquisition, independent of soil conditioning. Low rhizobia-availability allowed both effects only in endophyte-conditioned soil. Conclusion Endophyte-induced changes in soil (i) hindered symbiotic potential by reducing AMF spore availability or rhizobia nodulation, (ii) impaired legume survival irrespective of belowground symbionts presence, but (iii) mimicked rhizobia effects, enhancing growth and nitrogen fixation in poorly nodulated plants. Our results show that shoot and root symbionts can be interactively involved in interspecific plant-soil feedback.","[Garcia-Parisi, P. A.; Grimoldi, A.

The natural abundance of stable N isotope ratios (delta N-15) has been used as an indicator of the N status of an ecosystem. However, how plant and soil delta N-15 signatures would respond to N addition is still unclear. Methods and aims Herein, we synthesized the data of 951 observations from 48 individual studies associated with responses of plant and soil delta N-15 values to N addition and conducted a meta-analysis to explore a general pattern ofN addition effects on delta N-15 values of plant and soil. Results Our results showed that delta N-15 values of plant, soil total N, and soil NO3 (-) were significantly increased by N addition, while delta N-15 value of soil N2O was significantly decreased and delta N-15 value of soil NH4+ was not significantly changed. The delta N-15 value of soil total N of different ecosystems showed similar responses to N addition, whereas delta N-15 values of different plant types showed different responses. Increasing treatment duration significantly increased the effects of inorganic N addition on delta N-15 values of shrubs and soil NH4+ but did not affect the responses of delta N-15 values of soil total N and NO3 (-). With increasing inorganic N addition rate, only delta N-15 value of plant was significantly increased, but no significant relationship was found between the effect of N addition on other components and N addition rate because of the input of isotopically depleted sources. Conclusions Our study revealed a comprehensive picture of the effects of N addition on delta N-15 signatures in terrestrial ecosystems and could help us understand how plant and soil delta N-15 signatures change with N addition and how these signatures can be used as an indicator of ecosystem N status under increasing N deposition or fertilization.","[Liu, Jun; Wang, Chao; Peng, Bo; Xia, Zongwei; Jiang, Ping; Bai, Edith] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Bai, E (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, 72 Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",baie@iae.ac.cn,"Xi, Dan/M-7934-2013","Xi, Dan/0000-0002-0506-7234; liu, jun/0000-0001-9311-1874","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954400]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31522010]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC006]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program; 2014CB954400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31522010), and Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDB-SSW-DQC006).",,46,4,4,6,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2017,412,2-Jan,,,,,453,464,,10.1007/s11104-016-3081-0,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,ER7UT,WOS:000399020200033,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wicaksono, CY; Aguirre-Guiterrez, J; Nouhra, E; Pastor, N; Raes, N; Pacheco, S; Geml, J",,,,"Wicaksono, Christian Y.; Aguirre-Guiterrez, Jesus; Nouhra, Eduardo; Pastor, Nicolas; Raes, Niels; Pacheco, Silvia; Geml, Jozsef",,,Contracting montane cloud forests: a case study of the Andean alder (Alnusacuminata) and associated fungi in the Yungas,BIOTROPICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Andes; Argentina; Bolivia; DNA metabarcoding; ITS rDNA; montane cloud forests; mycorrhizal; species distribution modeling,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALNUS-ACUMINATA; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; SOIL; SPECIFICITY; COMMUNITY; DNA,"Alnus acuminata is a keystone tree species in the Yungas forests and host to a wide range of fungal symbionts. While species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely used for plants and animals to study the effects of climate change on montane forest communities, employing SDMs in fungi has been hindered by the lack of data on their geographic distribution. The well-known host specificity and common biogeographic history of A.acuminata and associated ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi provide an exceptional opportunity to model the potential habitat for this symbiotic assemblage and to predict possible climate-driven changes in the future. We (1) modeled the present and future distributions of suitable habitats for A.acuminata; (2) characterized fungal communities in different altitudinal zones of the Yungas using DNA metabarcoding of soil and root samples; and (3) selected fungi that were significant indicators of Alnus. Fungal communities were strongly structured according to altitudinal forest types and the presence of Alnus. Fungal indicators of Alnus, particularly ECM and root endophytic fungi, were also detected in Alnus roots. Current and future (year 2050) habitat models developed for A.acuminata predict a 25-50 percent decrease in suitable area and an upslope shift of the suitable habitat by ca. 184-380m, depending on the climate change scenario. Although A.acuminata is considered to be an effective disperser, recent studies suggest that Andean grasslands are remarkably resistant to forest invasion, and future range contraction for A.acuminata may be even more pronounced than predicted by our models. ResumenAlnus acuminata es una especie arborea clave en el ecosistema de las Yungas, siendo hospedante de una gran diversidad de simbiontes fungicos. Mientras que el uso de modelos de distribucion de especies (MDS) se ha vuelto rutinario para estudiar los efectos del cambio climatico sobre las comunidades vegetales y animales en bosques de montana, la carencia de datos de distribucion geografica para comunidades fungicas ha obstaculizado el uso de MDS en hongos. No obstante, teniendo en cuenta la alta especificidad de los simbiontes ectomicorricicos (ECM) asociados al aliso, se uso una aproximacion indirecta para estimar la distribucion potencial del habitat de los hongos restringidos a los bosques de Alnus, basandose en el modelado de la ocurrencia del hospedante. En este trabajo 1) se modelo la distribucion presente y futura de habitat adecuado para A.acuminata; 2) se caracterizaron las comunidades fungicas en diferentes zonas altitudinales de las Yungas usando metagenomica en muestras de suelo y raices; y 3) se seleccionaron aquellos hongos que fueran indicadores de Alnus. Las comunidades fungicas mostraron una fuerte estructuracion segun los tipos de bosques altitudinales y a la presencia de Alnus. Los hongos resultaron indicadores de Alnus, destacandose los hongos ECM y endofitos radicales, tambien fueron encontrados mayoritariamente en las raices de Alnus. Los modelos de habitat presente y futuro (2050) desarrollados para A.acuminata predijeron una perdida del 25 a 50 por ciento del area adecuada y un cambio de entre 184 a 380m en la distribucion del area adecuada hacia mayores elevaciones dependiendo del escenario de cambio climatico aplicado. Aunque A.acuminata es considerado un dispersor muy efectivo, estudios recientes sugieren que los pastizales andinos son muy resistentes a invasiones de vegetacion boscosa lo cual puede indicar que futuras contracciones en el area ocupada por A.acuminata pueden ser mas severas de lo que nuestros modelos indican.","[Wicaksono, Christian Y.; Geml, Jozsef] Leiden Univ, Fac Sci, POB 9502, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Aguirre-Guiterrez, Jesus; Raes, Niels; Geml, Jozsef] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Biodivers Dynam Res Grp, Vondellaan 55,POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Aguirre-Guiterrez, Jesus] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, Computat Geoecol, Sci Pk 904, NL-1098 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nouhra, Eduardo; Pastor, Nicolas] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Pacheco, Silvia] Fdn ProYungas, Peru 1180, RA-4107 San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina","Geml, J (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Fac Sci, POB 9502, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.; Geml, J (reprint author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, Biodivers Dynam Res Grp, Vondellaan 55,POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",Jozsef.Geml@naturalis.nl,"Geml, Jozsef/C-2223-2018; Raes, Niels/A-9645-2011","Geml, Jozsef/0000-0001-8745-0423; Raes, Niels/0000-0002-4329-4892","Eduardo Nouhra (SECYT, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba) [26/11, 162/12, 124/13]; Jozsef Geml's Naturalis personal research budget; Alberta Mennega Foundation; Martin Fellowship of Naturalis and Jesus Aguirre-Gutierrez from CONACyT Mexico [310005]; Eduardo Nouhra","Financial support for the fieldwork was provided by Eduardo Nouhra (SECYT, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, 26/11; 162/12; 124/13), Jozsef Geml's Naturalis personal research budget, and a fieldwork support grant awarded to Jozsef Geml by the Alberta Mennega Foundation.

Coupling data on seedling foliar damage from herbivores and pathogens and DNA sequencing of soil AMF diversity, we assessed the effects of these factors on tree seedling mortality at local (1 m(2)) and community (16 ha plot) scales in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico. At the local scale, AMF diversity in soil counteracted negative effects from foliar damage on seedling mortality. At the community scale, mortality of seedlings of common tree species increased with foliar damage while rare tree species benefited from soil AMF diversity. Together, the effects of foliar damage and soil AMF diversity on seedling mortality might foster tree species coexistence in this forest.","[Bachelot, Benedicte] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, 130 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Uriarte, Mara; McGuire, Krista L.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [McGuire, Krista L.] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Thompson, Jill; Zimmerman, Jess] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Environm Sci, Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Thompson, Jill] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate Penicuik, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland","Bachelot, B (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, 130 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27701 USA.",bmb43@duke.edu,,,"Institute of Latin American Studies at Columbia University; Columbia University; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8811902, DEB 9411973, DEB 0080538, DEB 0218039, DEB 0620910, DEB 0963447]","This work was supported by grants from the Institute of Latin American Studies at Columbia University to M.

After one and a half years of N addition at four rates (N-0, control; N-20, 20; N-50, 50; N-100, 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), we investigated the amount and allocation of biomass and the C and N pools in several parts of the ecosystem, including shrubs (leaves, shoots and branches, coarse roots and fine roots), grass (above- and below-ground) and litter (wood and leaf debris) components, and seven depth intervals within the soil (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, 50-70 and 70-100 cm). The results were as follows: (i) total vegetation biomass showed a linear increase with the increase in N (P < 0.05), mainly from the increased root biomass in both shrubs and grasses, (ii) the ecosystem C and N storage were 36 and 3.26 kg m(-2), respectively, of which the shrub, grass, litter and soil components contributed 11.08, 0.47, 0.25 and 88%, respectively, to the C pool and 3.07, 0.16, 0.08 and 97%, respectively, to the N pool, (iii) the ecosystem N pool did not change in response to the addition of N, whereas the ecosystem C pool responded linearly to increasing N (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the alpine scrub ecosystem functions as a net C sink under increasing atmospheric N deposition, mainly by promoting belowground C sequestration.","[Wang, D.; He, H.

Following repeated findings of significant differences in soil nitrification beneath comparable stands at the Breuil experimental site, a reciprocal soil exchange experiment combining high (H)- and low (L)-nitrifying stands was conducted to highlight the effect of tree root colonization on the control of nitrification. Soil percent nitrification and fine root biomass were measured in undisturbed and in transplanted soil cores after 16 and 28 months. In undisturbed soils, the fine root biomass varied by tree species and explained only 14% of the variation in percent nitrification. In transplanted soil cores, percent nitrification converged, at different rates, towards values close to those measured in the undisturbed soil at the receptor stands. On the one hand, percent nitrification increased rapidly in soil cores from L transferred to H, while soil core colonization by roots remained low during the study period. Soil cores might have been colonized by active nitrifiers from their new environment, or/and the activity of the nitrifiers originally present was less suppressed by root activity in their new environment. On the other hand, percent nitrification decreased progressively in soil cores from H transferred to L as root colonization increased. This suggests that root colonization reduced nitrifier population and activity. Our findings suggest that the often-reported influence of forest species on soil nitrification is probably multifactorial but the tree root colonization contributes.","[Andrianarisoa, K.

Here we investigate growth and biomass allocation traits that might explain single-species' dominance of these post-disturbance stands, and their later decline in the absence of large-scale disturbance. Seedlings of 20 rain-forest trees were grown in two light treatments in a nursery house. In the sun treatment, monodominants grew faster (56.7 +/- 1.4 mg g(-1) wk(-1)) than subordinates (40.2 +/- 2.6 mg g(-1) wk(-1)). However, some episodically regenerating (ER) subordinates had high growth rates similar to those of monodominants. In the shade treatment, monodominants and subordinates had similar growth rates (33.7 +/- 2.6 and 34.0 +/- 1.9 mg g(-1) wk(-1) respectively). Notably, monodominants in both sun and shade treatments had lower root mass fraction (0.29 +/- 0.02 and 0.27 +/- 0.02 g g(-1) respectively) than subordinates (0.39 +/- 0.02 and 0.37 +/- 0.02 g g(-1)). Fast growth in sunny conditions is probably imperative for these relatively shade-intolerant ER monodominants. In field conditions, high shoot mass fraction combined with efficient root performance may facilitate faster growth in monodominants competing with other ER species in sunlit sites. Slower growth in shade may contribute to loss of dominance over time in undisturbed forests.","[Read, Jennifer; Sanson, Gordon] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [McCoy, Stephane] Vale New Caledonia, Environm Conservat Serv, BP 218, Noumea 98845, New Caledonia; [Jaffre, Tanguy] Herbarium NOU, IRD, UMR AMAP, BP A5, Noumea 98800, New Caledonia; [Logan, Murray] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia","Read, J (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",jenny.read@monash.edu,,,Committee for Research and Exploration of the National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [8798-10],"We are grateful to Vale New Caledonia for allowing this experiment to be conducted at their Environmental Conservation Service nursery facility, and thank their staff for invaluable assistance in preparing and maintaining the seedling experiment.

Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of variation in the genetic composition and function of rhizobial communities is critical to understanding rhizobial impacts on community and ecosystem productivity. In this study, we examined how environmental factors and host species jointly affect rhizobial phenotypic diversity and community structure. Individual host plants of two native Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and A.stenophylla, were inoculated with a community of six rhizobial strains (belonging to three genera) previously characterized for symbiotic effectiveness. The plants were grown in a fully factorial experiment under high and low phosphorus and water, and high or no nitrogen. Half the plants were harvested after 19weeks and the other half after 30weeks. The relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was characterized using amplicon sequencing of the rhizobial 16S rRNA gene from DNA extracted from the root nodules of plants after each harvest. Variation in the relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was best explained by host species, although interactions between environment and host species also emerged as significant predictors of variation in rhizobial community composition. We detected strong host-specific interactions for two strains, while two other strains were clearly generalists, being relatively abundant in both host species. For both host species, the two generalist strains were as abundant as the best specialist strain within the rhizobial community. Synthesis. Our study show host species identity as the key determinant of rhizobial community structure within the root nodules of Acacia plants. Strains that were efficient at promoting the growth of their host plant had high relative abundance in experimental communities. Furthermore, interaction among host species, rhizobial host-range, and environmental variation determine the structure of rhizobial communities, although not in clearly predictable ways. Such interactions contributed to the maintenance (albeit at relatively low frequencies) of ineffective strains in nodule communities. These interacting effects could help to explain why rhizobial communities are functionally diverse, such that specialists, generalists and seemingly ineffective rhizobia, can be simultaneously maintained in rhizosphere communities.","[Vuong, Holly B.; Thrall, Peter H.; Barrett, Luke G.] CSIRO Agr & Food, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Vuong, HB (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Infect Dis, Ctr Vaccine & Immunol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",hollyvuong.work@gmail.com,,,CSIRO OCE Postdoctoral Fellowship.,We thank Kristy Lam for technical assistance with the glasshouse and laboratory work.

While some aboveground obligate symbionts are considered defensive mutualists of host plants, the importance of root endophytes in plant defense, especially against root-feeding insects, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of root fungal endophytes on plant resistance against belowground herbivores and the recovery of host plants from damage. We grew the common grass Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue) semi-aeroponically in the laboratory and inoculated roots with one of five fungal endophytes isolated from field-collected tall fescue or meadow soil. Endophyte-inoculated and uninoculated control plants were subjected to feeding by larvae of the generalist root herbivore Rhizotrogus majalis (European chafer). Herbivory intensity was quantified after eight days, and regrowth of roots and shoots following root herbivory and mechanical shoot damage was measured thereafter for each treatment. Fungal identifications by DNA sequence analysis were conducted after completion of the herbivory experiments and revealed that the five endophytes included the decomposer fungi Trametes versicolor and Mortierella alpina, the entomopathogenic fungi Isaria fumosorosea and Beauveria bassiana, and a potential plant pathogen/entomopathogen Fusarium cf. equiseti. The effects of these root endophytes on plant defense against root-feeding insects were species-specific. While four endophytes had few effects on plant resistance, endophytic B. bassiana significantly reduced herbivore damage to roots. In comparison, plant tolerance to damage was impaired after colonization by all endophyte species except T. versicolor and M. alpina. The contrasting effects of endophytes on plant resistance and plant tolerance suggest that research solely evaluating plant resistance is likely to overestimate the benefits conferred by endophytes without accounting for potential negative effects on plant tolerance. We propose a conceptual framework to include both plant resistance and tolerance as two dimensions of a defensive strategy and show that plant associations with different root endophytes may shift the relative importance of resistance and tolerance for plant defense.","[Gan, Huijie; Wickings, Kyle] Cornell Univ, NY State Agr Expt Stn, Dept Entomol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Churchill, Alice C.

In 2015, the kernel densities of both AWB and BRB had a lower mass in the left tail and a greater mass in the right tail than those in 2010. Both AWB and BRB changed especially at the right end of the biomass distribution and less at the left end. The counterfactual decomposition approach, used to identify the sources of kernel density changes in the biomass distributions from 2010 to 2015, revealed that forest attributes contributed jointly to the observed biomass dynamics. The change in species richness (SR), accounting for less than 10% of overall changes in biomass at all estimated quantiles, has only a minor effect on the AWB and BRB dynamics in two studied forests. But the decrease in tree density (TD) and the increase in stand density (SD) from 2010 to 2015 contributed positively toward the observed density changes in AWB and BRB. Therefore, the changes in TD (measured in terms of the number of trees per ha) and SD (measured in terms of the basal area per ha) were identified as important drivers of biomass dynamics in the two studied forests. Overall, diameter skewness and diameter inequality exert greater influence at the highest quantiles of biomass distribution than at the lowest. It indicates that the changes in diameter structures will further increase biomass dispersion. The results support the assumption that specific methods of selective thinning may be effective to improve the biomass production in the natural forests. Further studies are needed to explore relevant details.","[Zhang, Chunyu; Cheng, Yanxia; He, Huaijiang; Gao, Lushuang; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jingjing] West Virginia Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Zhang, CY (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zcy_0520@163.com,,,"Program of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31670643, 31600480]",This research is supported by the Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670643; 31600480).,,59,0,0,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,MAR,2017,8,3,,,,,,,e01752,10.1002/ecs2.1752,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EP0UO,WOS:000397102400042,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Lai, ZR; Liu, JB; Zhang, YQ; Wu, B; Qin, SG; Sun, YF; Zhang, JT; Feng, W; Fa, KY; Bai, YX",,,,"Lai, Zongrui; Liu, Jiabin; Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shugao; Sun, Yanfei; Zhang, Jutao; Feng, Wei; Fa, Keyu; Bai, Yuxuan",,,"Introducing a shrub species in a degraded steppe shifts fine root dynamics and soil organic carbon accumulations, in northwest China",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon turnover; Decomposition; Fractions; Litter input; Minirhizotron,LAND-USE CHANGE; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; CARAGANA-MICROPHYLLA; DECOMPOSITION RATES; NATIVE PASTURE; CO2 EXCHANGE; AFFORESTATION; LITTER; FRACTIONS; STOCKS,"In the semiarid and arid regions of China, the introduction of shrubs into degraded steppe is generally considered a crucial tool to facilitate vegetation restoration and reduce desertification. However, the resultant changes in root dynamics, plant composition and soil carbon have not been completely evaluated, casting doubt on the ecological viability of this method. In this study, the fine root dynamics and soil organic carbon (SOC) of two land-use types, Caragana microphylla shrubland (CM-shrubland) and a natural restoration steppe (NR-steppe) in northwest China were compared. Fine root biomass and production of CM-shrubland were lower by 65.7% and 43.9%, respectively, than those in the NR-steppe, in soil depths down to 80 cm. Herbaceous fine roots in the CM-shrubland had the fastest turnover and decomposition rates, followed by herbaceous plants in the NR-steppe, and then by C. microphylla. Differences in SOC stocks between land-use types (including a decrease in the shrubland compared to the steppe) were reflected in the heavy fraction of SOC storage in the subsoil layer (60-80 cm), rather than in total and heavy fraction of SOC in the top soil layer (0-60 cm). Surprisingly, the light fraction of SOC increased slightly (8.7%) after C. microphylla introduction. Thus, changes in fine root dynamics contributed to differences in SOC and its fractions between the CM-shrubland and NR-steppe. These patterns suggest that, in terms of soil C sequestration, shrub restoration might not be an effective choice for land degradation control. Instead, a moderately protected steppe is a better approach for ecological restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Vegetation may be one of the most effective measures in streambank stabilization. Traditionally, research on the influence of vegetation roots on streambank stabilization has focused on mechanical reinforcement and reduced applied shear stress due to above ground biomass. Few studies have investigated the effect of roots on fluvial detachment of sediment. This study conducted 36 mini-jet erosion tests (mini JETS)on bare soil samples and 29 mini JETS on root-permeated soil samples (average root diameters of 0.5 to 1.7 mm) to determine the role of roots in erosion resistance. The research also estimated parameters of the linear excess shear stress model (erodibility coefficient, k(d), and critical shear stress, tau(c)) and a nonlinear detachment model called the Wilson Model (b(0) and b(1)) and investigated the correlations between parameters of the two models and root characteristics. Root-permeated soil samples were more erosion resistant at higher shear stress as the tau(c) and b(1) parameters were on average higher for the vegetated samples than the bare soil samples. As root diameter increased in the soil samples, erosion rates at high shear stress decreased. The erodibility coefficient parameters (b(0) and k(d)) of both the linear and nonlinear detachment models were negatively and significantly correlated to root diameter through power functions. No significant correlation was detected between critical shear stress or b(1) and root parameters which supports conclusions of previous studies. Significant correlations were observed among the parameters of the excess shear stress model and the nonlinear detachment model; especially high correlation was observed between tau(c) and b1 for the vegetated samples. In conclusion, root-permeated soils exhibited lower erosion rates primarily through increasing the required shear stress before detachment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Borrowing concepts from natural selection theory, we propose that trait-abundance relationships can generally correspond to one of three modes of trait selection: directional (a rectilinear relationship, where species at one end of a trait axis are most abundant), stabilizing (an n-shaped relationship), and disruptive (a u-shaped relationship). Stabilizing selection (i.e., the functional convergence of abundant species) would result from positive density-dependent interactions (e.g., facilitation) or due to generalized trade-offs in resource acquisition/use, while disruptive selection (i.e., the divergence of abundant species) would result from negative density-dependent interactions (e.g., competition) or due to environmental heterogeneity. These selection modes can be interpreted as proxies for community-level trait-fitness functions, which establish the degree to which traits are truly ""functional"". We searched for selection modes in a desert annual-plant community in Argentina (which was divided into winter and summer guilds) to test the hypothesis that the relative importance of disruptive mechanisms (competition, disturbances) decreases with the increase of abiotic stress, a stabilizing agent. Average density was analyzed as a function of eight traits generally linked to resource acquisition and competitive ability (maximum plant height, leaf size, specific leaf area, specific root length), resource retention and stress tolerance (leaf dissection, leaf dry matter content, specific root volume), and regeneration (seed mass) using multiple quadratic-regression models. Trait selection was stabilizing and/or directional when the environment was harshest (winter) and disruptive and/or directional when conditions were milder (summer). Selection patterns differed between guilds for two important traits: plant height and seed mass. These results suggest that abiotic stress may drive within-community functional convergence independently of the trait considered, opposing the view that some traits may be inherently convergent while others divergent. Our quadratic model-based approach provides standardized metrics of both linear and nonlinear selection that may allow simple comparisons among communities subjected to contrasting environmental conditions. These concepts, rooted in natural selection theory, may clarify the functional link between traits and species abundance, and thus help untangle the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes on community assembly.","[Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Natur, Dept Biolog, Ignacio Roza Oeste 590,J5402DCS, San Juan, PR, Argentina; [Rolhauser, Andres G.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agronom, IFEVA, CONICET, San Martin 4453, RA-C1417DSE Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Rolhauser, AG (reprint author), Univ Nacl San Juan, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Natur, Dept Biolog, Ignacio Roza Oeste 590,J5402DCS, San Juan, PR, Argentina.",rolhauser@ifeva.edu.ar,,"Rolhauser, Andres/0000-0001-6781-6723","FONCyTFONCyT [PICT 01322, 2449]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","We thank Marisa Nordenstahl, Agostina B.

Many studies have evaluated the performances of this restoration projects in aspects of vegetation, soils, hydrology, wildlife, etc. In contrast, limited information was available on the effects of restoration projects on the soil microbial biomass and community composition. To better understand the wetland restoration, differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition between restored tidal wetlands and unrestored wetlands under the disturbance of petroleum exploitation activities or tidal intrusion were assessed. Surface soils (0-10 cm) under three different plant covers (Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa and bare land) were collected from each three wetland zones. Chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis were used to characterize soil microbial biomass and community composition. Our results showed significantly elevated microbial biomass in soils of the restoration zone, as indicated by both microbial biomass carbon and total PLFAs. Soil microbial community composition in the restoration zone also differed significantly from those in the petroleum exploitation zone and tidal zone. The freshwater input of restoration projects induced a soil microbial community shift to the increased relative abundance of fungi and decreased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio bacteria. The significantly promoted fungi in soils under P. australis of the restoration zone reflected the necessity of decomposers of the increased surface plant residues after restoration, which in turn contributed to the organic residues accumulation in soils and large aggregates formation by fungal hyphae. Meanwhile the modified soil carbon pool and aggregate structure following restoration of degraded wetland may favor the colonization of soil organisms. These results indicated that freshwater input had strongly altered soil microbial communities in the restored wetland, which may be of great significance in understanding the soil microbial responses to the restoration projects and the underlying mechanisms of wetland restoration.

Extracellular enzymes play critical roles on the degradation of soil organic matter, and measurements of their activities are potentially useful indicators of SR. The links between soil extracellular enzymatic activities (EEAs) and SR under N addition, however, have not been established. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis from 62 publications to synthesize the responses of soil EEAs and SR to elevated N. Nitrogen addition significantly increased glycosidase activity (GA) by 13.0%, alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AG) by 19.6%, beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) by 11.1%, beta-1,4-xylosidase (BX) by 21.9% and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH) by 12.6%. Increases in GA were more evident for long duration, high rate, organic and mixed N addition (combination of organic and inorganic N addition), as well as for studies from farmland. The response ratios (RRs) of GA were positively correlated with the SR-RRs, even when evaluated individually for AG, BG, BX and CBH. This positive correlation between GA-RR and SR-RR was maintained for most types of vegetation and soil as well as for different methods of N addition. Our results provide the first evidence that GA is linked to SR under N addition over a range of ecosystems and highlight the need for further studies on the response of other soil EEAs to various global change factors and their implications for ecosystem functions.","[Chen, Ji; Wang, Rui-Wu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ji; Cao, Junji; Wang, Yunqiang; Jin, Zhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, Key Lab Aerosol Chem & Phys, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol SKLLQG, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ji] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ji; Luo, Yiqi; Shelton, Shelby; Feng, Wenting] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Luo, Yiqi] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianwei; Jian, Siyang] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA; [Zhou, Xuhui; Zhou, Lingyan] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Tiantong Natl Field Observat Stn Forest Ecosyst, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xuhui] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Cao, Junji] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Walker, Laura M.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Feng, Zhaozhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Niu, Shuli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wang, RW (reprint author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Ecol & Environm Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.; Cao, JJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Earth Environm, Key Lab Aerosol Chem & Phys, State Key Lab Loess & Quaternary Geol SKLLQG, Xian 710061, Peoples R China.; Li, JW (reprint author), Tennessee State Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Nashville, TN 37209 USA.; Cao, JJ (reprint author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Inst Global Environm Change, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",jli2@tnstate.edu; cao@loess.llqg.ac.cn; wangrw@nwpu.edu.cn,"Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018; Jin, Zhao/B-4757-2009; Junji, Cao/D-3259-2014; Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011; Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019","Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312; Jin, Zhao/0000-0003-2547-4723; Junji, Cao/0000-0003-1000-7241; Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901","Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [2012BAH31B03]; State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [SKLLQG1303]; Terrestrial Ecosystem Sciences grant from the U.S. Department of Energy [DE SC0008270]; US National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI 0850290, EPS0919466, DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, EF 1137293]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture - Evans-Allen project [1005761]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31290221, 31070407, 31370489]; National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2010CB833502]; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; 'Thousand Young Talents' Program in China; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council","This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (2012BAH31B03) and the State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SKLLQG1303).

We predict that if functional differences are important for co-existence, then both species and functional diversity should be positively related to environmental heterogeneity. LocationThirty three dry calcareous grassland sites in Estonia. MethodsIn each site, we established a transect (10.0mx0.1m), consisting of 100 quadrats (10cmx10cm). In each quadrat, we recorded species richness and composition, and measured soil depth, moisture and light availability. We collected data on eight traits from most of the species found across the sites. We calculated functional diversity (FD) at the quadrat scale, and compared the observed FD to that expected at random using two null models. The first null model used all the species that occurred in the transect in the randomizations to determine environmental filtering from the transect to the quadrat. The second null model restricted the species used in the randomizations to those species whose trait range was within the range of the observed values in the quadrat, to detect evidence for niche partitioning. Quadrat mean trait values and variability in functional composition were then related to small-scale mean environmental conditions and heterogeneity, respectively. ResultsWe found convergent patterns in biomass, specific leaf area, specific root length and clonality compared to randomized communities that included all species occurring in the transect, and found divergence in height and leaf area using the range-restricted null model. Hence, we found patterns consistent with environmental filtering and niche partitioning depending on the traits considered. Quadrat mean traits were significantly correlated with the measured environmental variables, with the main trend being a positive relationship between size-related traits and soil resources, and a negative relationship between these traits and light availability. Trait variability in height, leaf area, leaf dry matter content, specific root length and clonality was positively related to soil depth heterogeneity. There was a trend for species richness to be negatively related to environmental heterogeneity. ConclusionsCo-occurring species were more similar in several traits partly due to micro-environmental filtering in response to variability in soil depth. While environmental heterogeneity increased trait variability, negative relationships with species richness were observed. Hence, niche partitioning does not appear to be important for the maintenance of high small-scale species richness in these grasslands.","[Price, Jodi] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Price, Jodi] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Tamme, Riin; Gazol, Antonio; Takkis, Krista; Kasari, Liis; Partel, Meelis] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Tamme, Riin] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Gazol, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Pirena Ecol, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Na Zlate Stoce 1, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Uria-Diez, Jaime] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Fac Forest Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Price, J (reprint author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.; Price, J (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",joprice@csu.edu.au; Riin.Tamme@ut.ee; agazol@ipe.csic.es; fradebello@ctfc.es; krista.takkis@gmail.com; jaime.uria.diez@slu.se; Liis.Kasari@ut.ee; Meelis.Partel@ut.ee,"Uria-Diez, Jaime/H-3651-2019; Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015","Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543",European Union through the European Social Fund (MOBILITAS post-doctoral grant) [MJD47]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange); ERMOS programme Grant - Marie Curie Actions [14]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research Institutional Research Funding [IUT20-29]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/12/1296]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental DecisionsAustralian Research Council,"This research was supported by the European Union through the European Social Fund (MOBILITAS post-doctoral grant MJD47), the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange), ERMOS programme Grant 14 (co-funded by Marie Curie Actions), Estonian Ministry of Education and Research Institutional Research Funding IUT20-29, the Czech Science Foundation (grant P505/12/1296) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

In general, the distribution of plant species is assumed to be controlled by dispersal or environmentally controlled recruitment. For plant species which are critically dependent on mycorrhizal symbionts for germination and seedling establishment, specificity in mycorrhizal associations and availability of suitable mycorrhizal fungi can be expected to have a major impact on successful colonization and establishment and thus ultimately on a species distribution. We combined seed germination experiments with soil analyses and fungal assessments using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing to test the relative importance of dispersal limitation, mycorrhizal availability and local growth conditions on the distribution of the orchid species Liparis loeselii, which, despite being widely distributed, is rare and endangered in Europe. We compared local soil conditions, seed germination and mycorrhizal availability in the soil between locations in northern Belgium and France where L.loeselii occurs naturally and locations where conditions appear suitable, but where adults of the species are absent. Our results indicated that mycorrhizal communities associating with L.loeselii varied among sites and plant life cycle stages, but the observed variations did not affect seed germination, which occurred regardless of current L.loeselii presence and was significantly affected by soil moisture content. These results indicate that L.loeselii is a mycorrhizal generalist capable of opportunistically associating with a variety of fungal partners to induce seed germination. They also indicate that availability of fungal associates is not necessarily the determining factor driving the distribution of mycorrhizal plant species.","[Waud, Michael; Jacquemyn, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Waud, Michael; Lievens, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, Campus Nayer, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium; [Brys, Rein; Van Landuyt, Wouter] Res Inst Forest & Nat, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Waud, M (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.; Waud, M (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Microbial & Mol Syst M2S, Lab Proc Microbial Ecol & Bioinspirat Management, Campus Nayer, B-2860 St Katelijne Waver, Belgium.",michael.waud@kuleuven.be,"Lievens, Bart/B-3339-2019; Van Landuyt, Wouter/J-8959-2012; Jacquemyn, Hans/AAC-4875-2019","Jacquemyn, Hans/0000-0001-9600-5794; , Rein/0000-0002-0688-3268; Van Landuyt, Wouter/0000-0002-1915-4486",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [260601]; KU LeuvenKU Leuven,"The authors would like to thank Filiep T'Jollyn for assistance during field work, Pieter Pollet and Kasper Van Acker for soil analyses, Bert Wayenberg for his assistance preparing amplicon libraries for sequencing and three anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions on a previous version of this manuscript.

This effect is associated with the modification of microclimatic conditions, soil carbon inputs, and the decay rates of woody detritus. In addition, slope aspect may determine SR rates by modifying the microclimatic conditions in post-fire environments. In this study, we assessed the changes in SR rates during the early (1.5-4 years) post-fire stages in a burnt and logged Spanish Black pine forest along a burn-severity gradient: (1) an unburnt site (UB), (2) a low burn-severity site (LS), (3) a south-facing high burn-severity site (HSS), and (4) a north-facing high burn-severity site (HSN). Monthly or fortnightly manual SR measurements (SRM) were taken at midday between 2011 and 2013. In addition, we also quantified the litter layer and fine-root biomass at each site. Multiple regression models combining abiotic (both soil temperature and water content, T-s and SWC, respectively) and biotic (tree diameter at breast height, 1.30 m) were used for midday SRM modelling. For temporal and spatial scaling of SR at the stand-level, we performed 8 seasonal campaigns of automated SR measurements (SRA) along 4 linear gradients from trees or stumps to inter-tree/stump gaps with the aim of: (1) determining the main soil-surface areas (soil close to trees or stumps and/or soil away from them; SC and SA soil, respectively) and (2) correcting the modelled daily daytime and night-time SRM rates. Our results showed a significant reduction in fine-root biomass at the burnt sites, although over the 3-year study period this figure did tend to increase. The amount of litter was similar between sites suggesting that logging practices may influence the amount of post-fire detritus. We also found that the spatial variability in soil microclimate was high and was primarily influenced by post-fire canopy cover as well as the slope aspect. SR rates significantly varied between years and were higher in SA soil compared to SC soil at all the sites we studied. Higher SR rates were observed close to stumps compared to those close to trees, highlighting the large relative contribution of this decaying debris to post-fire SR rates. In the medium-term, the combined effect of fire and logging practices may lead to an increase in the annual stand-level SR at high burn-severity sites after fire. In contrast, the interaction between fire and logging practices did not alter the post-fire SR rates at the LS site during the same time period. Our results also underscored the dependence of post-fire SR rates on the slope aspects within the high-severity fire area. Finally, this study showed that our integrated spatio-temporal approach could be a useful tool for obtaining more accurate SR estimates for short-, medium- and long-term stand-scale carbon cycling studies in burnt areas.

This study aimed to provide new insights into CeO2 NPs plant uptake through two objectives: (1) to investigate whether CeO2 NPs dissolute before their plant uptake and (2) to determine the in-planta speciation of Ce. Bench scale experiments were conducted by growing radish in solutions containing 10 mg elemental Ce/L of bulk CeO2 particles, CeO2 NPs or ionic Ce. Transmission electron microscope and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis suggested that one pathway for CeO2 NPs uptake was through direct uptake of intact CeO2 NPs. More importantly, our results confirmed that part of the particulate CeO2 was transformed into ionic Ce on the root surface before they were taken up by plants. Ionic Ce uptake and transport was a primary mechanism for Ce accumulation in plant shoots. This study further demonstrated that enhanced CeO2 dissolution on root surface was due to the organic acids with lower molecular weight (e. g. succinic acid) in radish root exudates. Large particles composed of high contents of P and Ce were detected in radish roots treated only with ionic Ce, suggesting the formation of CePO4 particles. In summary, the results indicated that CeO2 NPs was taken up by radish as both intact nanoparticles and dissolved ions. Inside plant tissues, Ce is present as a cocktail of CeO2 NPs, dissolved Ce and Ce salt (e. g. CePO4) and the specific combination of Ce species is tissue dependent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study used a soil strength experiment carried out in a greenhouse to test the hypotheses that increasing soil strength would adversely affect seedling morphology and alter seedling architecture by changing biomass allocation patterns. We explored the effects of soil compaction in a loam to clay-loam textured soil with optimal conditions of water on a continuous scale (0.2-1.0 MPa penetration resistance) on growth responses of the deciduous Quercus castaneifolia (C.A. Mey). Both above- and below-ground seedling characteristics, including size and biomass, were negatively affected by soil compaction. At the highest intensity of compaction, size and growth were reduced by 50% compared to controls; negative effects were typically more severe on below-ground (i.e., the length and biomass of the root system) than on above-ground responses. Increasing soil strength did not change above-and below-ground biomass allocation patterns (i.e., root mass ratio, root: shoot ratio, specific root length), resulting in unchanged seedling architecture. Strong adverse effects were already evident in the low-intensity compaction treatment and no critical soil strength threshold was observed. We conclude that root and height growth in Q. castaneifolia seedlings is limited by any increase of soil strength, though no evidence for the disruption of a functional equilibrium between above-and below-ground plant portions was found up to soil strengths of 1.0 MPa, at least under optimal water supply.","[Jourgholami, Meghdad; Khoramizadeh, Azadeh] Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Zob E Ahan St, Karaj 315854314, Iran; [Zenner, Eric K.] Pennstate Univ, Coll Agr Sci, 305 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA USA","Jourgholami, M (reprint author), Univ Tehran, Dept Forestry & Forest Econ, Zob E Ahan St, Karaj 315854314, Iran.",mjgholami@ut.ac.ir,"Jourgholami, Meghdad/L-4512-2019","Jourgholami, Meghdad/0000-0003-3676-278X",Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [93014726],"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF), project No. 93014726.

However, poor shoot and fine root growth has been a frequent issue in inoculated Quercus seedlings production. Fertilisation is a common solution in forest nurseries, but high fertilisation levels have been found to inhibit the formation of ectomycorrhizas of many fungal species. The influence of slow- release fertilisation ( 52 mg N, 26 mg P and 36 mg K per seedling) on growth and ectomycorrhizal status of Tuber melanosporum-inoculated seedlings was evaluated. Host species Quercus ilex and Quercus faginea and inoculation methods involving root-dipping and root-powdering were tested. Fertilisation increased weight of both host species without significant detrimental effects on ectomycorrhizal colonisation, showing that it can be effectively used in inoculated seedlings production. Both host species showed similar response to fertilisation. The inoculation method affected seedling weight and ectomycorrhizal status, suggesting that some inoculant carriers are able to damage Quercus development and T. melanosporum colonisation. The study provided an important basis for fine- tuning the use of fertilisers in truffle-inoculated seedling production.","[Garcia-Barreda, Sergi] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Recursos Forest, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Garcia-Barreda, Sergi] Ctr Invest & Expt Truficultura Diputac Huesca, Poligono Fabardo S-N, Graus 22430, Spain; [Molina-Grau, Sara] Fdn Ctr Estudios Ambientales Mediterraneo, C Charles Darwin 14 Parque Tecnol, Paterna 46980, Spain; [Reyna, Santiago] Univ Politecn Valencia, ETS Ingn Agron & Medio Nat, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46021, Spain","Garcia-Barreda, S (reprint author), Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Recursos Forest, Avda Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.; Garcia-Barreda, S (reprint author), Ctr Invest & Expt Truficultura Diputac Huesca, Poligono Fabardo S-N, Graus 22430, Spain.",sergigarciabarreda@gmail.com,"Garcia-Barreda, Sergi/I-1204-2013","Garcia-Barreda, Sergi/0000-0002-7248-234X","Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Government of Spain) [PET2007-13-C07-04]","This work was funded by Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA, Government of Spain) project PET2007-13-C07-04.",,38,2,2,0,14,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,FEB,2017,10,,,,,,267,272,,10.3832/ifor2096-009,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,EN2TC,WOS:000395862000036,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Reid, ML; Emery, SM",,,,"Reid, Matthew L.; Emery, Sarah M.",,,Native and exotic foundation grasses differ in traits and responses to belowground tri-trophic interactions,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biological invasion; Plant-parasitic nematodes; Root architecture; Sand dunes,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENEMY RELEASE HYPOTHESIS; SAND DUNE SUCCESSION; INVASIVE PLANTS; AMMOPHILA-ARENARIA; COASTAL DUNES; UNITED-STATES; SOIL BIOTA; COMMUNITIES; NEMATODES,"A plant's growth and fitness are influenced by species interactions, including those belowground. In primary successional systems, belowground organisms are known to have particularly important control over plant growth.

We investigated the growth responses of two foundation grasses on Great Lakes sand dunes, the native grass Ammophila breviligulata and the exotic grass Leymus arenarius, to two groups of soil organisms with important roles in dune succession: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). We manipulated the presence/absence of two generalist belowground species known to occur in Great Lakes dunes, Rhizophagus intraradices (AMF) and Pratylenchus penetrans (PPN) in a factorial greenhouse experiment and assessed the biomass production and root architectural traits of the plants. There were clear differences in growth and above-and belowground architecture between Ammophila and Leymus, with Leymus plants being bigger, taller, and having longer roots than Ammophila. Inoculation with Rhizophagus increased above-and belowground biomass production by similar to 32% for both plant species. Inoculation with Pratylenchus decreased aboveground biomass production by similar to 36% for both plant species. However belowground, the exotic Leymus was significantly more resistant to PPN than the native Ammophila, and gained more benefits from AMF in belowground tritrophic interactions than Ammophila. Overall, our results indicate that differences in plant architecture coupled with altered belowground interactions with AMF and PPN have the potential to promote exotic plant invasion.","[Reid, Matthew L.; Emery, Sarah M.] Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, 139 Life Sci Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA","Reid, ML (reprint author), Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, 139 Life Sci Bldg, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",matthew.reid.1@louisville.edu,,,Kentucky Academy of Sciences Botany Fund; Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research,"We thank Katie Arstingstall, Brad Gottshall, Andrea Howes, and Erin Kinnetz for the assistance throughout the experiment.

Spore diversity and community composition differed significantly between the two islands. The less degraded island, Terceira, showed 10 exclusive morphotypes including more rare types, whereas the more disturbed forest on Sao Miguel showed 13 morphs, mostly of common types. Forests from Terceira were dominated by Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae. Whereas members of Acaulosporaceae, Glomeraceae and Ambisporaceae were most frequent and abundant in those from Sao Miguel.

However, how this diversity of fungi responds to different human disturbances is not well understood. Methods In this study, we examined the effects of different human disturbance on fungal diversity in hair roots of Vaccinium mandarinorum, an ericaceous plant. Fungal DNA was extracted from hair roots of V. mandarinorum and high-throughput sequencing was applied to detect the diversity of root-associated fungi along a human disturbance gradient in subtropical forests in Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR) in East China. The four forest types with different disturbance regime were: old growth forest (OGF), secondary forest with once cut (SEC I), secondary forest with twice cut (SEC II) and Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation (PLF). Important Findings The results showed that: (i) diverse fungal operational units (OTUs) were detected in hair roots of V. mandarinorum in the four types of forests, covering fungal phyla of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota; (ii) Community composition of root-associated fungi of V. mandarinorum in PLF was distinct from those in the other three forest types, and two types of secondary forests had similar fungal community composition; (iii) Different fungal families respond differently to human disturbances: fungal families with significant preference to OGF were ectomycorrhizal or saprophytic fungi while fungal families with higher relative abundance in PLF were plant pathogenic or saprophytic fungi; (iv) The first principal component (PC1) of plant community had a significant effect on composition of root-associated fungal community, while edaphic parameters showed no significant effect on fungal community composition in roots of V. mandarinorum. Our results help to better understand the responses of both ericaceous plants and their fungal partners to human disturbances and forest managements.","[Zhang, Yanhua; Ni, Jian; Tang, Fangping; Guo, Tianrong; Sun, Lifu] Shaoxing Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengnan Rd 900,Yuecheng Dist, Shaoxing 312000, Peoples R China; [Pei, Kequan; Liang, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lifen; Sun, Lifu] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, 101 David L Boren Blvd, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Sun, LF (reprint author), Shaoxing Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengnan Rd 900,Yuecheng Dist, Shaoxing 312000, Peoples R China.; Liang, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Sun, LF (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, 101 David L Boren Blvd, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",sunlifu@usx.edu.cn; coolrain@ibcas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31170469, 31170495, 31470565]; Technology division of Shaoxing [2013B70040]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 31170469, 31170495 and 31470565) and Technology division of Shaoxing (2013B70040).

Carbon exuded comes from a pool of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in roots. Simple models of diffusion across concentration gradients indicate that the more C in roots, the more C should be exuded from roots. However, the mechanisms underlying the accumulation and loss of C from roots may differ depending on the stress experienced by plants. Thus, stress type may influence exudation independent of NSC. We tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between NSC in fine roots and exudation of organic C in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings after exposure to shade, cold soils and drought in a controlled environment. Fine root concentrations of NSC varied by treatment. Mass-specific C exudation increased with increasing fine root sugar concentration in all treatments, but stress type affected exudation independently of sugar concentration. Seedlings exposed to cold soils exuded the most C on a per mass basis. Through C-13 labeling, we also found that stressed seedlings allocated relatively more new C to exudates than roots compared with unstressed seedlings. Stress affects exudation of C via mechanisms other than changes in root carbohydrate availability.","[Karst, Justine; Gaster, Jacob; Wiley, Erin; Landhausser, Simon M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada","Karst, J (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",justine.karst@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,62,13,13,4,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2017,37,2,,,,,154,164,,10.1093/treephys/tpw090,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,EP0BR,WOS:000397052300002,27744381,Other Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Raich, JW",,,,"Raich, James W.",,,Temporal Variability of Soil Respiration in Experimental Tree Plantations in Lowland Costa Rica,FORESTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate change; climate warming; forest carbon cycle; plant-soil system; soil carbon cycle; tropical forest; tropical forest phenology; tropical rainforest,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; WOODY REGENERATION; CARBON DYNAMICS; ORGANIC-CARBON; CO2 EFFLUX; LA-SELVA; CLIMATE; GROWTH; SENSITIVITY,"The principal objective of this study was to determine if there is consistent temporal variability in soil respiration from different forest plantations in a lowland tropical rainforest environment. Soil respiration was measured regularly over 2004 to 2010 in replicated plantations of 15-to 20-year-old evergreen tropical trees in lowland Costa Rica. Statistically significant but small differences in soil respiration were observed among hours of the day; daytime measurements were suitable for determining mean fluxes in this study. Fluxes varied more substantially among months, with the highest average emissions (5.9 mu mol.m(2).s(-1)) occurring in September and low emissions (3.7 mu mol.m(2).s(-1)) occurring in January. Three of the six tree species had significantly increasing rates of soil respiration across 2004-2010, with fluxes increasing at an average of 0.09 mu mol.m(2).s(-1) per year: the three other species had no long-term trends. It was hypothesized that there would be a tradeoff between carbon allocation aboveground, to produce new leaves, and belowground, to sustain roots and mycorrhizae, but the relationship between canopy leaf fall-a surrogate for canopy leaf flushing-and soil respiration was significantly positive. The similarities observed among temporal trends across plantation types, and significant relationships between soil respiration, soil water content and soil temperature, suggest that the physical environment largely controlled the temporal variability of soil respiration, but differences in flux magnitude among tree species were substantial and consistent across years.","[Raich, James W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Raich, JW (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jraich@iastate.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0343766, DEB-0703561]","This work work was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation grants DEB-0343766 and DEB-0703561.

Past tracer studies show that litter and soils dominate the short-term fate of added N-15, yet few have examined its longer term dynamics or differences among forest types. This study examined the fate of a N-15- tracer over 5-6years in a mixed deciduous stand that was evenly composed of trees with ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. The tracer was expected to slowly mineralize from its main initial fate in litter and surface soil, with some N-15 moving to trees, some to deeper soil, and some net losses. Recovery of added N-15 in trees and litterfall totaled 11.3% both 1 and 5-6years after the tracer addition, as N-15 redistributed from fine and especially coarse roots into cumulative litterfall and small accumulations in woody tissues. Estimates of potential carbon sequestration from tree N-15 recovery amounted to 12-14kg C per kg of N deposition. Tree N-15 acquisition occurred within the first year after the tracer addition, with no subsequent additional net transfer of N-15 from detrital to plant pools. In both years, ectomycorrhizal trees gained 50% more of the tracer than did trees with arbuscular mycorrhizae. Much of the N-15 recovered in wood occurred in tree rings formed prior to the N-15 addition, demonstrating the mobility of N in wood. Tracer recovery rapidly decreased over time in surface litter material and accumulated in both shallow and deep soil, perhaps through mixing by earthworms. Overall, results showed redistribution of tracer N-15 through trees and surface soils without any losses, as whole-ecosystem recovery remained constant between 1 and 5-6years at 70% of the N-15 addition. These results demonstrate the persistent ecosystem retention of N deposition even as it redistributes, without additional plant uptake over this timescale.","[Goodale, Christine L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Goodale, CL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",clg33@cornell.edu,,,NSF CAREERNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DEB-0845451]; Cornell Agroecology (USDA) Programs,"Oliver Schaufelberger made many valued contributions to this project that merit special recognition.

The activity of surface enzymes was determined on ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal roots. In soils, the activity of a range of enzymes, nitrogen (N) mineralization and biomass decomposition were determined. The community structure of the ectomycorrhizal community of Picea abies and Pinus mugo differed strongly, but the average activity of surface enzymes of the ectomycorrhizal communities was similar.

This response is consistent with known patterns about root-stem allometry under favorable conditions (humidity and stand density). The study investigated partitioning of resources between roots and stems in mono-species and mixed-species stands of Douglas-fir and European beech at four different sites. We combined tree ring analyses of stems and coarse roots to scrutinize root-stem allometry with a focus on how it is influenced by species mixture and humidity. The results show that allometry in mixed stands changed in favor of stem growth for both species. The greatest relative allocation into stem growth was observed for individual trees which were completely surrounded by trees of the other species. The data indicate that a decrease of stand density, which was used as a proxy for tree competition, has the same effect on allocation. To analyze the influence of humidity, we used a long- and short-term index. Based on these, we can show that allocation changes with general site conditions and annual humidity variations. We found that on both time scales, both species increase resource investment into stem growth if conditions are more humid. Under harsher conditions, allocation shifts into root growth. The findings contribute to understanding the overyielding in mixed stands. Mixing Douglas-fir and European beech leads to the same allocation patterns as an improvement of site conditions. We suggest that for both species, mixture is equivalent to growing on a better site.","[Thurm, Eric Andreas; Biber, Peter; Pretzsch, Hans] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Thurm, Eric Andreas] Bavarian State Insitute Forestry, Dept Soil & Climate, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 1, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Thurm, EA (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.; Thurm, EA (reprint author), Bavarian State Insitute Forestry, Dept Soil & Climate, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 1, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Thurm@lrz.tum.de,"Pretzsch, Hans/AAC-5565-2019","Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868","Bavarian State Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry [7831-22206-2013]","We wish to thank the Bavarian State Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forestry for providing the Funds of W44 'Douglas-fir-European beech mixed and pure stands' (Grant Number 7831-22206-2013).",,89,7,9,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Understanding how tree seedlings respond to warming soil temperature is critical for predicting population recruitment in the future hardwood forests of northeastern North America, particularly as environmental conditions and thus optimal microhabitat availabilities change. We examined the effect of soil warming of 5 degrees C during the first growing season on germination, survival, phenology, growth, and stem and root biomass allocation in Acer rubrum L. (red maple) seedlings. While there was no effect of soil warming on germination or survival, seedlings growing in warmer soils demonstrated significantly accelerated leaf expansion, delayed autumn leaf senescence, and an extended leaf production period. Further, seedlings growing in warmer soils showed larger leaf area and stem and root structures at the end of the first growing season, with no evidence of biomass allocation trade-offs. Results suggest that A. rubrum seedlings can capitalize on soil warming by adjusting leaf phenology and leaf production, resulting in a longer period of carbon uptake and leading to higher overall biomass. The absence of growth allocation trade-offs suggests that A. rubrum will respond positively to increasing soil temperatures in northeastern forests, at least in the early life stages.","[Wheeler, J.

We analyzed the responses of two willow clones with contrasting responses to flooding (clone B, Salix matsudana x Salix alba hybrid; clone Y, Salix alba) to different combinations of stress treatments: continuous flooding or drought for six weeks, or cyclic treatments of two weeks of stress separated by two weeks of watering at field capacity. Drought reduced growth, stomatal conductance, and total leaf area in both clones, but flooding did not. Flooding reduced the root to shoot ratio in both clones. The hydraulic conductivity of the main stem was significantly reduced by drought only in clone Y. The area of the vessels was decreased by both drought and flooding, but the number was increased only by drought. The occurrence of drought before flooding reduced the vessel area, but the opposite treatment did not. An episode of drought after one of flooding is more stressful than the opposite situation, especially for clone Y, which could not adjust its water transport capacity during the drought period.","[Doffo, Guillermo N.; Monteoliva, Silvia E.; Rodriguez, Maria E.; Luquez, Virginia M.

In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assemblages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18 % of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community structures in these highly diverse ecosystems.","[Schimann, Heidy; Louisanna, Eliane] Univ Guyane, Univ Antilles, INRA, UMR Ecol Guiana Forests,AgroParisTech,CNRS,CIRAD, F-97310 Kourou, France; [Bach, Cyrille; Lengelle, Juliette; Murat, Claude; Buee, Marc] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR Interact Arbres Microorganisms, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Barantal, Sandra] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Equipe Environm & Microbiol, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Rech Environm & Mat, F-64000 Pau, France","Schimann, H (reprint author), Univ Guyane, Univ Antilles, INRA, UMR Ecol Guiana Forests,AgroParisTech,CNRS,CIRAD, F-97310 Kourou, France.",heidy.schimann@ecofog.gf,,"Schimann, Heidy/0000-0002-9139-920X; Murat, Claude/0000-0003-0685-7307","Investissement d'Avenir grantFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; French National Research Agency (ANR), ""Investissements d'Avenir"" program (Lab of Excellence ARBRE)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","The authors are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their comments and contributions in improving this manuscript.

Spatial heterogeneity affects plant performance and is influenced by plants, but the scale at which fine roots react to or generate spatial heterogeneity has received little attention. Fine roots might be expected to respond to heterogeneity at a scale comparable to their diameter (mm), but studies to date have been conducted at much coarser resolutions (cm - m). Here we quantify root heterogeneity in contrasting habitats with special attention to the influence of resolution. 2. We measured fine root length heterogeneity at resolutions ranging from 1 to 300 mm 2, at four elevations along an arctic alpine gradient from 500 m a.s.l. (forest) to 1100 m (tundra). We calculated the magnitude of heterogeneity as the coefficient of variation of root length, and the scale of heterogeneity using semivariance analysis. 3. The magnitude of heterogeneity was about twofold greater at fine than coarse resolution. Further, the magnitude of heterogeneity was generally greatest at the highest elevation, suggesting that soil at 1100 m was less evenly occupied by plant roots than soils at lower elevations. The exception to this was at the 1 mm 2 resolution, for which the magnitude of heterogeneity did not vary with elevation, possibly because heterogeneity at this scale is related to ecophysiological processes common to all vegetation types. 4. The scale of root length heterogeneity increased significantly with resolution coarseness, suggesting that roots respond to or generate patchiness at small scales that have not previously been examined. In contrast, the scale of heterogeneity did not vary significantly with elevation and the accompanying turnover in growth form. 5. Our results suggest that roots in four vegetation types respond to or generate very fine scales of spatial heterogeneity, including scales much smaller than those that have previously been examined. Both the magnitude and scale of heterogeneity varied with sampling resolution, suggesting resolutions as small as a few millimetres are relevant to studies of spatial root interactions and below-ground processes.","[Trager, Sabrina; Wilson, Scott D.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Wilson, Scott D.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, S-98107 Abisko, Sweden","Trager, S (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",trger20s@uregina.ca,,,German Academic Exchange ServiceDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [57140539]; University of Regina; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank A.

This study aims to compare AMF community structure along a transect crossing a fluvial-marine island and relate these communities with soil and vegetation parameters to shed light on the forces driving AMF. community structure on a local scale. We tested the hypothesis that the composition of AMF communities changes across the island, even within short distances among sites, in response to differences in edaphic characteristics and vegetation physiognomies. We sampled roots and soils in five different natural and degraded habitats: preserved mangrove forest (MF), degraded mangrove forest (MD), natural Restinga forest (RF), and two regeneration Restinga forests (RR1 and RR2) on Ilha da Restinga, northeastern Brazil. We determined the mycorrhizal colonization rate and AMF community structure based on morphological spore identification. The island soils were sandy with pH varying from acid to neutral; higher levels of organic matter were registered in RF and lower in MF; other chemical and physical soil attributes differed along the habitat types on the island. In total, 22 AMF species were identified, without any difference in species richness. However, the diversity and composition of AMF communities, spore abundance per families, and mycorrhizal colonization were statistically different among the habitats. The composition of AMF communities was strongly related to soil characteristics, especially the sum of exchangeable bases. Our results indicate that the different habitat types have diverse AMF communities even within short distances among habitats. In conclusion, islands with high spatial heterogeneity in soil parameters and diverse vegetation are potential refuges for the diversity conservation of AM fungi. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Carbon sequestration, estimated at 45 and 73 t CO2 eqha(-1) for C. ladanifer and E. arborea, respectively, was subsequently determined.

We conducted a literature survey to identify potential environmental controls on the root:shoot biomass ratio (R:S) across tropical forests worldwide. Moreover, to aid efforts to extrapolate aboveground biomass measurements to belowground C stocks, we also compiled a list of allometric equations for coarse root biomass. Across our large and geographically comprehensive dataset, we found that R:S is negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation, and positively linked with stand age. However, information on root biomass allocation is still scarce in comparison with the wealth of available data on aboveground plant biomass in tropical forests, and more data will be necessary to understand the drivers of belowground biomass allocation. Moreover, the available root allometric equations show tremendous variation in mathematical form, which is likely related to the many different methods that have been used to quantify root biomass and its distribution with depth. A better understanding of belowground dynamics in tropical forests will require systematic surveys of root biomass along gradients of soil type, climate, and stand age, along with a streamlined protocol for developing root allometric equations.

Climate models predict that the frequency, intensity and duration of drought events will increase in tropical regions. Although water withdrawal from deep soil layers is generally considered to be an efficient adaptation to drought, there is little information on the role played by deep roots in tropical forests. Tropical Eucalyptus plantations managed in short rotation cycles are simple forest ecosystems that may provide an insight into the water use by trees in tropical forests. 2. The contribution made by water withdrawn from deep soil layers to the water required for evapotranspiration was quantified daily from planting to harvesting age for a Eucalyptus grandis stand using a soil water transfer model coupled with an ecophysiological forest model (MAESPA). The model was parameterized using an extensive data set and validated using time series of the soil water content down to a depth of 10 m and water-table level, as well as evapotranspiration measured using eddy covariance. 3. Fast root growth after planting provided access to large quantities of water stored in deep soil layers over the first 2 years. Eucalyptus roots reached the water-table at a depth of 12 m after 2 years. Although the mean water withdrawal from depths of over 10 m amounted to only 5% of canopy transpiration from planting to a harvesting age of 5 years, the proportion of water taken up near the water-table was much higher during dry periods. The water-table rose from 18 to 12 m below-ground over 2 years after the harvest of the previous stand and then fell until harvesting age as evapotranspiration rates exceeded the annual rainfall. 4. Deep rooting is an efficient strategy to increase the amount of water available for the trees, allowing the uptake of transient gravitational water and possibly giving access to a deep watertable. Deep soil layers have an important buffer role for large amounts of water stored during the wet season that is taken up by trees during dry periods. Our study confirms that deep rooting could be a major mechanism explaining high transpiration rates throughout the year in many tropical forests.","[Christina, Mathias; Nouvellon, Yann; Laclau, Jean-Paul; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre; le Maire, Guerric] CIRAD, UMR ECO&SOLS, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Nouvellon, Yann; Bouillet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Forest Sci Dept, Av Padua Dias 11,CP 9, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Laclau, Jean-Paul] Univ Estadual Paulista, Forest Sci Dept, Av Prof Montenegro, BR-18618970 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Stape, Jose L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Lambais, George R.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Av Centenario 303,CP 96, BR-13400970 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [le Maire, Guerric] Embrapa Meio Ambiente, BR-13820000 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil","le Maire, G (reprint author), CIRAD, UMR ECO&SOLS, F-34398 Montpellier, France.; le Maire, G (reprint author), Embrapa Meio Ambiente, BR-13820000 Jaguariuna, SP, Brazil.",guerric.le_maire@cirad.fr,"Laclau, Jean-Paul/O-2189-2019; Nouvellon, Yann/C-9295-2016; Christina, Mathias/F-5698-2016","Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; Nouvellon, Yann/0000-0003-1920-3847; le Maire, Guerric/0000-0002-5227-958X; Christina, Mathias/0000-0003-3618-756X","Arcelor Mittal; Cenibra; Copener; Duratex; Fibria; International Paper; Klabin; Suzano; Vallourec Florestal; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho; Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD); Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-AGRO0005]; Viabilite et Adaptation des Ecosystemes Productifs; Territoires et Ressources face aux Changements Globaux AGROBIOSPHERE; USP-COFECUB [2011-25]; Ecofor, Allenvi and the French National Research Infrastructure ANAEE-F; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/06412-3]","We are grateful for the support of the EUCFLUX project (funded by Arcelor Mittal, Cenibra, Copener, Duratex, Fibria, International Paper, Klabin, Suzano and Vallourec Florestal), Universidade de Sao Paulo, Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita Filho, Centre de cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD), Agence Nationale de la Recherche (MACACC project ANR-13-AGRO0005, Viabilite et Adaptation des Ecosystemes Productifs, Territoires et Ressources face aux Changements Globaux AGROBIOSPHERE 2013 program), USP-COFECUB (Project 2011-25).

Higher plant species diversity has been largely reported to increase aboveground community biomass, but how biodiversity affects fine-root production and the related mechanisms in forests remain unclear. In this study, we aim to answer two questions: (i) does fine-root production increase with tree species richness? (ii) Can this effect be explained by niche complementarity among species? Methods We analyzed data from a large forest biodiversity experiment (BEF-China) with 5-year-old trees. Fine-root growth was measured as standing biomass and annual fine-root regrowth was estimated using ingrowth cores. Moreover, relative yield was calculated to test whether over-or under-yielding occurred when mixtures were compared with the average monoculture of the species included in the mixtures. We calculated functional diversity for fine-root (<= 2 mm in diameter) traits by Rao's quadratic entropy index for each species mixture. The effects of manipulated tree species richness and identity on fine-root traits were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Mixed models were also used to test the relationships between tree species richness and fine-root standing biomass, annual regrowth and vertical heterogeneity. Important Findings Fine roots of more than one species were found in half of the soil cores in mixtures indicating that belowground interactions in these young forest stands occurred much earlier than canopy closure. We found significant differences among species in fine-root traits such as diameter and specific root length (SRL), which suggested different resource-use strategies and niche partitioning among species. Mean fine-root diameter of species ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 mm, mean SRL ranged from 12.43 m.g(-1) to 70.22 m.g(-1) and mean vertical distribution index beta ranged from 0.68 to 0.93. There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and the evenness of the vertical distribution of fine-root standing biomass. Moreover, marginally significant positive relationships existed between species richness and standing biomass as well as annual regrowth of fine roots. Relative yields and Rao's quadratic entropy index were both not significantly affected by species richness. However, the relative yield of fine-root standing biomass was marginally correlated with Rao's quadratic entropy index, implying that belowground niche complementarity between species does contribute to diversity effects. In conclusion, our study showed positive effects of species richness on the filling of soil volume by fine roots in the studied experimental forest communities. This has positive effects on fine-root standing biomass and may also lead to increased aboveground biomass.","[Sun, Zhenkai; Liu, Xiaojuan; Bu, Wensheng; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sun, Zhenkai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaojuan; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Am Kirchtor 1, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Ma, KP (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214","Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion in Beijing; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270496, 31300353]",We are grateful to Chen Lin for coordinating the field assistants in root sampling.

Our objective was to assess the role of resource partitioning and species interactions as two important mechanisms that can bring about CEs by interspecific and intraspecific trait variation. Methods We measured tree height of 2493 living individuals in 57 plots and specific root length (SRL) on first-order roots of 368 of these individuals across different species richness levels (1, 2, 4, 8 species) in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiment in subtropical China (BEF-China) established in 2009. We describe the effects of resource partitioning between species by a fixed component of interspecific functional diversity (RaoQ) and further effects of species interactions by variable components of interspecific and intraspecific functional diversity (community weighted trait similarity and trait dissimilarity, CWS and CWD). Finally, we examined the relationships between biodiversity effects on stand-level tree height and functional diversity (RaoQ, CWS and CWD) in SRL using linear regression and assessed the relative importance of these three components of functional diversity in explaining the diversity effects. Important Findings Our results show that species richness significantly affected SRL in five and tree height in ten out of 16 species. A positive NE was generally brought about by a positive CE on stand-level tree height and related to high values of RaoQ and CWS in SRL. A positive CE was related to high values of all three components of root functional diversity (RaoQ, CWS and CWD). Our study suggests that both resource partitioning and species interactions are the underlying mechanisms of biodiversity effects on stand-level tree growth in subtropical forest.","[Bu, Wensheng; Liu, Xiaojuan; Liang, Yu; Sun, Zhenkai; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Bu, Wensheng] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard; Huang, Yuanyuan] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolut Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Li, Ying; Haerdtle, Werner] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Ma, KP (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Bu, Wensheng/0000-0002-5617-9789",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31300353]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561089]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department [GJJ150384],"This project was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31300353), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2014M561089) and Science and Technology Planning Project of Jiangxi Provincial Education Department (No. GJJ150384).",,65,25,28,6,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

This study aimed to characterize soil water flow and plant root distribution in response to preferential flow paths and quantitatively describe the relation between plant root distribution and soil water flow. Field dye-tracing experiments centered on experimental plants were conducted to determine the root length density and soil water flow process. Laboratory analyses were performed to characterize changes in the relative concentration of the accumulated effluent and the degree of interaction between plant roots and soil water flow. The amount of fine plant roots with preferential flow paths decreased with increasing soil depth for all experimental plots. The largest plant roots were recorded in the upper soil layers to a depth of 20cm. The relative concentration of the accumulated effluent increased with time and decreased with soil depth under saturated soil conditions, whereas a distinct early turning point for the relative concentration of the accumulated effluent was observed in the 0-20-cm soil columns, and the relative concentration of the accumulated effluent initially decreased and then increased with time under unsaturated soil conditions.

One mechanism that can increase the likelihood of species co-existence, and thus species diversity, is a trade-off between competitive ability and the magnitude of plant growth response to AM fungal inoculation. By suppressing the growth of strong competitors while simultaneously enhancing the growth of weak competitors, this trade-off would cause the competitive hierarchy to be less pronounced in soil inoculated with AM fungi relative to non-inoculated conditions. To test whether such a trade-off exists, we quantified competitive abilities and mycorrhizal growth response (MGR) among 21 species that co-occur in old fields in southern Ontario. Competitive ability was determined by calculating competitive effect (CE), or the degree to which each species suppressed the biomass of a common phytometer species, Plantago lanceolata. Higher CE values represent stronger competitive ability. Old-field species varied in their ability to suppress the biomass of the phytometer and MGR was generally positive. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between CE in non-inoculated soil and MGR (r = -0.49, P = 0.02). In addition, variance in CE was 73% lower in soil inoculated with AM fungi compared to non-inoculated soil (P = 0.0023). These findings support the hypothesis that AM fungi weaken strong competitors while enhancing the performance of weak competitors. Because this trade-off compressed the competitive hierarchy among old-field species in soil inoculated with AM fungi, it may be a mechanism by which mycorrhizal fungi enhance species evenness and diversity.","[Stanescu, Sabina; Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada","Maherali, H (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada.",maherali@uoguelph.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation through the Early Researcher Award program; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation,"This research was funded by a Discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation through the Early Researcher Award program, and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.

Mycorrhizal feedbacks can be conspecific, which affects individuals of the same species, or heterospecific, which affects individuals of a different species. When heterospecific feedbacks are more positive than conspecific feedbacks, heterospecific individuals are expected to outcompete conspecific individuals. To test this hypothesis, we quantified conspecific mycorrhizal feedback for Plantago lanceolata as a focal species, and heterospecific mycorrhizal feedbacks for 21 competitor old-field species using mycorrhizae cultured with P. lanceolata. We quantified inter-specific competition against the focal species by growing the 21 old-field species with and without P. lanceolata in the presence of mycorrhizae cultured with P. lanceolata. Heterospecific and conspecific feedbacks were both positive, and average heterospecific feedbacks exceeded conspecific feedback by 75%. Competition suppressed P. lanceolata biomass by 14% and average competitor biomass was reduced by 44% in the presence of P. lanceolata, and these effects varied with competitor species identity. Contrary to predictions, the magnitude of heterospecific feedbacks did not predict the ability of competitor species to either suppress or resist suppression by P. lanceolata. Instead, the outcome of competition was significantly and positively correlated with intrinsic growth rate, measured as biomass of competitor species five weeks after germination in non-inoculated conditions. Our findings suggest that species experiencing more positive mycorrhizal feedbacks than a competitor do not necessarily have a competitive advantage. Mycorrhizal mediated soil feedbacks may be less important than intrinsic differences in growth rate in determining competitive outcomes.","[Stanescu, Sabina; Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Maherali, H (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",maherali@uoguelph.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation through the Early Researcher Award program; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation,"This research was funded by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation through the Early Researcher Award program, and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.",,59,6,6,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2017,126,2,,,,,248,258,,10.1111/oik.03580,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EL5IU,WOS:000394655600012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kou, L; McCormack, ML; Chen, WW; Guo, DL; Wang, HM; Gao, WL; Yang, H; Li, SG",,,,"Kou, Liang; McCormack, M.

Through a three-year minirhizotron experiment, we investigated the responses of ECM lifespan to different rates of N addition and examined the roles of N ion form, rooting depth, seasonal root cohort, and ECM morphotype in mediating the N effects on ECM lifespan in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii) forest in subtropical China. High rates of NH4Cl significantly decreased foliar P concentrations and increased foliar N:P ratios, and mean ECM lifespan was negatively correlated to foliar P concentration. N additions generally increased the lifespan of most ectomycorrhizas, but the specific differences were context dependent. N rates and forms exerted significant positive effects on ECM lifespan with stronger effects occurring at high N rates and under ammonium N addition. N additions extended lifespan of ectomycorrhizas in shallower soil and born in spring and autumn, but shortened lifespan of ectomycorrhizas in deeper soil and born in summer and winter. N additions reduced lifespan of dichotomous ectomycorrhizas, but increased lifespan of coralloid ectomycorrhizas. The increased ECM lifespan in response to N additions may primarily be driven by the persistent and aggravated P limitation to plants. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental contexts in controlling ECM lifespan and the need to consider potential differences among mycorrhizal morphotypes when studying N-lifespan relationships of absorptive roots in the context of N deposition.","[Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Guo, Dali; Wang, Huimin; Gao, Wenlong; Yang, Hao; Li, Shenggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kou, Liang; Chen, Weiwei; Gao, Wenlong; Li, Shenggong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [McCormack, M.

On a 3 year old trial comparing yield of five cool season forage grass species at two N fertilization levels (190 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) or 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) we sampled root and stubble biomass until a depth of 90 cm deep.

The total dry biomass below cutting height (stubble + roots up to a depth of 90 cm below the soil surface) varied between 18 and 19 tonnes ha(-1) for tall fescue and 10 and 11 tonnes ha(-1) for Festulolium at 190 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Our findings emphasize that in intensively managed grassland, root and stubble biomass under a 3 years old sward can be as high as 19 t DM ha(-1). Owing to the high forage and root biomass of tall fescue, this species has a high potential in maintaining several ecosystem services.","[Cougnon, Mathias; De Frenne, Pieter; Shahidi, Reihaneh; Reheul, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Prod, Proefhoevestr 22, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [De Swaef, Tom; Lootens, Peter; Baert, Joost; Roldan-Ruiz, Isabel] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Plant Sci Unit, Caritasstr 39, B-9090 Melle, Belgium","Cougnon, M (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Prod, Proefhoevestr 22, B-9090 Melle, Belgium.",mathias.cougnon@ugent.be,"De Frenne, Pieter/N-4969-2014; De Swaef, Tom/I-1272-2019","De Frenne, Pieter/0000-0002-8613-0943; ",,,,32,9,10,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2017,411,2-Jan,,,,,409,422,,10.1007/s11104-016-3034-7,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,EK7ZE,WOS:000394142900029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Binet, MN; van Tuinen, D; Souard, F; Sage, L; Perigon, S; Gallet, C; Legay, N; Lavorel, S; Mouhamadou, B",,,,"Binet, Marie-Noelle; van Tuinen, Diederik; Souard, Florence; Sage, Lucile; Perigon, Sophie; Gallet, Christiane; Legay, Nicolas; Lavorel, Sandra; Mouhamadou, Bello",,,Responses of above- and below-ground fungal symbionts to cessation of mowing in subalpine grassland,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Endophyte fungi; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community; Grassland dynamics,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LOLIUM-PERENNE; LAND-USE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT; ENDOPHYTE SYMBIOSIS; FESTUCA-PANICULATA; PLANT DIVERSITY; SOIL; GRASSES,"The cessation of mowing in subalpine grasslands promotes the dominance of Festuca paniculata leading to the reduction in plant diversity. Moreover, it affects positively the abundance of Epichloe sp. inhabiting F paniculata leaves and negatively the soil density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We explored how the cessation of mowing influences root AMF communities in F. paniculata and the neighboring plants, and Epichloe sp alkaloids. Thirteen AMF operational taxonomical units were found. The neighboring plants affected positively the abundances of Aalpin and GLOM_7 whereas the interaction plant/management type influenced significantly Claroide_1, GLOM_1 and GLOM_7. The N-formylnorloline, produced by Epichloe sp. increased in unmown grassland. Hence, the cessation of mowing, coinciding with the high abundance of endophyte alkaloid, affected root-associated AMF with differential responses at the abundance level. The N-formylnorloline could be one compound underpinning the dynamic of plant diversity with a resulting structuration of AMF in subalpine grasslands.

Diamond mining in the Northwest Territories produces large amounts of processed kimberlite, and in some cases lake bed sediment and reclamation is needed for re-establishment of ecosystem function. This study investigated early fungal colonization with arbuscular mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes on common reclamation substrates of different ages, relative to native tundra. Natural colonization of vegetation free sites with mycorrhizal spores on a trajectory associated with substrate age and type was very low. Fungal spore quantity and diversity was significantly accelerated by establishment of vegetation. Dark septate endophytes dominated native site Cyperaceae whereas reclamation site grasses were dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizae. Topsoil amendment was most effective for fungal colonization on reclamation substrates suggesting that a single application of topsoil can have a long term effect on the soil fungal community.

Species-abundance distributions (SADs) are a community attribute that can be used to study changes in the overall abundance structure of species groups, and whether these changes are driven by abundant or rare species. We evaluated the effect of grassland management intensity for three land-use modes (fertilization, mowing, grazing) and their combination on species richness and SADs for three belowground (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, prokaryotes and insect larvae) and seven aboveground groups (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens; arthropod herbivores; arthropod pollinators; bats and birds). Three descriptors of SADs were evaluated: general shape (abundance decay rate), proportion of rare species (rarity) and proportional abundance of the commonest species (dominance). Across groups, taxonomic richness was largely unaffected by land-use intensity and only decreased with increasing mowing intensity. Of the three SAD descriptors, abundance decay rate became steeper with increasing combined land-use intensity across groups. This reflected a decrease in rarity among plants, herbivores and vertebrates. Effects of fertilization on the three descriptors were similar to the combined land-use intensity effects. Mowing intensity only affected the SAD descriptors of insect larvae and vertebrates, while grazing intensity produced a range of effects on different descriptors in distinct groups. Overall, belowground groups had more even abundance distribtitions than aboveground groups. Strong differences among aboveground groups and between above- and belowground groups indicate that no single taxonomic group can serve as an indicator for effects in other groups. In the past, the use of SADs has been hampered by concerns over theoretical models underlying specific forms of SADs. Our study shows that SAD descriptors that are not connected to a particular model are suitable to assess the effect of land use on community structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the contribution of fine roots in C japonica to the accumulation or depletion of Ca in soils with different ABCs has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to clarify the responses of C. japonica fine roots in terms of biomass and morphology in eight plantation stands to soils with two contrasting ABCs, which have different trends of soil acidification. We evaluated the biomass and specific root length (SRL) of fine roots divided into three diameter classes (<0.5, 0.5-1.0, and 1.0-2.0 mm), obtained from the organic layer and two mineral soil layers from 0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depths, in soils with high- and low-ABCs. We also investigated root traits of seedlings grown in soil monoliths in-situ in a greenhouse condition to compare the response of mature trees in stands. The biomass of fine roots (<2.0 mm) in mature C japonica was significantly higher and the SRL was significantly lower in low ABC soils than in high-ABC soils. In the organic layer, the biomass of very fine roots (<0.5 mm) at the organic soil layer in low ABC soils was higher than that in high ABC soils. However, the SRL and the dry weight of the seedlings in the greenhouse condition showed no differences between the soils with two contrasting ABCs. We concluded that fine roots of C japonica stands could have changed and contributed differently to soils with contrasting ABCs. The conflicting root responses of mature trees in stand and seedlings under controlled conditions suggest that careful caution should be taken to extrapolate in situ mature trees from the results of seedlings, particularly when evaluating the effects of soil degradation such as soil acidifications on sustainable C. japonica plantation forests.

Therefore, we investigated Ra and Rh using a trenching method in a young Cunninghamia lanceolate plantation, subjected to N and P fertilization in subtropical China. Soil CO2 efflux was measured from.December 2013 to November 2015. Mean annual Rs, Ra, and Rh rates decreased on average by 18.6%, 23.6%, and 17.1% after fertilization. The contribution of Rh to Rs ranged from 70.9% to 76.7%. This contribution was greater in P-fertilized plots, suggesting that fertilization changed the contribution of Rh and Ra to Rs. The reduced rate of Rh induced by fertilization contributed on average 66.9% to the decrease in Rs rate. This contribution for Rh was higher in NP-fertilized plots than in other plots Based on a bivariate model, 51.2%-69.3% and 53.6%-66.7% of the variations in Rs and Rh among different treatments were explained by soil temperature and moisture. However, temperature sensitivity of Rs and Rh were not affected by fertilization. Ra and Rh were positively related to fine root biomass. Rh was also positively related to soil organic C, dissolved organic C, and microbial biomass C, but negatively related to soil mineral N content. Our results highlight the importance of fertilization on soil CO2 efflux and its significance to the estimation of forest C sink potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the effects of elevated CO2 and drought on the microbial biomass and enzymatic activities in the rhizospheres of Bothriochloa ischaemum and Medicago sativa in loess soil. Drought exerted significant species -specific negative effects on root and shoot biomass and microbial properties except for the soil basal respiration in the rhizospheres of B. ischaemum and M. sativa. Increased CO2 exerted weak effects on plant biomass and enzymatic activities but demonstrated significant effects on the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soil microbial biomass, basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration, and the metabolic quotients in the rhizospheres of M sativa and B. ischaemum. The rhizosphere soil microbial index was a good aggregative indicator of the general state of the microbial properties of the rhizospheres. The interactive effects of elevated CO2 and drought on plant growth and microbial properties significantly differed, indicating that elevated CO2 significantly alleviated the effects of drought stress on the microbial properties of the rhizosphere. In addition, the effects of elevated CO2 and drought on microbial biomass and enzymatic activities considerably varied between the two selected species.

Prior studies of mycorrhizal associations in alien plants have tended to focus on individual plant species on a case-by-case basis. This approach limits broad scale understanding of functional shifts and changes in interaction network structure that may occur following introduction. Here we use two extensive datasets of plant-fungal interactions derived from fungal sporocarp observations and recorded plant hosts in two island archipelago nations: New Zealand (NZ) and the United Kingdom (UK). We found that the NZ dataset shows a lower functional diversity of fungal hyphal foraging strategies in mycorrhiza of alien when compared with native trees. Across species this resulted in fungal foraging strategies associated with alien trees being much more variable in functional composition compared with native trees, which had a strikingly similar functional composition. The UK data showed no functional difference in fungal associates of alien and native plant genera. Notwithstanding this, both the NZ and UK data showed a substantial difference in interaction network structure of alien trees compared with native trees. In both cases, fungal associates of native trees showed strong modularity, while fungal associates of alien trees generally integrated into a single large module. The results suggest a lower functional diversity (in one dataset) and a simplification of network structure (in both) as a result of introduction, potentially driven by either limited symbiont co-introductions or disruption of habitat as a driver of specificity due to nursery conditions, planting, or plant edaphic-niche expansion. Recognizing these shifts in function and network structure has important implications for plant invasions and facilitation of secondary invasions via shared mutualist populations.","[Dickie, Ian A.; Bufford, Jennifer L.; Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Box 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Cooper, Jerry A.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Bates, Scott T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Pathol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Dickie, IA (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, Box 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",ian.dickie@lincoln.ac.nz,"Bufford, Jennifer L/G-6653-2018; Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011; Dickie, Ian/C-5419-2013","Bufford, Jennifer L/0000-0003-3320-6024; Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; Dickie, Ian/0000-0002-2740-2128; Cooper, Jerry/0000-0003-4994-3897","Tertiary Education Commission CORE; New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","I.A.D., P.E.H. and J.L.B. are funded by Tertiary Education Commission CORE funding to the Bio-Protection Research Centre.

The seven inoculation treatments consisting of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM), Trichoderma (Tri), plant growth promoting bacteria (Pse) and their combinations (AM+Tri; AM+Tri+Pse; AM+Pse) together with three pepper hybrids and non-inoculation (control) plants were arranged in a randomized complete block design. Defense enzyme activities polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) of various treated plants were measured just before flowering, representing the most sensitive stage of plants. The results showed that AM+Tri+Pse treatment enhanced the yield most among microbial inoculations. Highest yield was recorded in the triple treatment in Karpex cultivar, however, Karpia and Kaptur variety obtained more improved yield by microbial inoculations. Defense enzymes activities generally were most induced in the combination of three inoculants in cultivars whereas different responses in induction of defense enzymes were found in other microbial treatments, depending on specific interactions between microbe and pepper genotype. These results suggested that the triple application brought more benefits to the host plant.","[Duc, N.

We estimated and analyzed the cumulative dry season drawdown of soil water across montane California using a spatially resolved water balance model that combined field, meteorological, and remote sensing observations. Dry season soil water drawdown varied markedly with elevation, increasing from <200mm/yr below 500m, to similar to 425mm/yr at 1000 to 2000m, before decreasing to <200mm/yr above similar to 3000m. Soil water drawdown was comparatively low at drier (mean annual precipitation<1000mm/yr) or colder (mean annual temperature<4 degrees C) locations; soil water drawdown was greater at wetter and warmer locations, including conifer forests. The reduced soil water drawdown at low-elevation dry locations may reflect inadequate precipitation to recharge the soil; the reduced water drawdown at high, cold locations presumably reflects limited storage capacity or sparse vegetation development. Soil water drawdown was reduced at locations that were glaciated during the Pleistocene and was only weakly related to rock type. The amount of soil water drawdown implies that many California ecosystems are deeply rooted, with conifer forest rooting to at least 3.6m. Deep rooting allows many California ecosystems to limit current summer moisture limitation and suggests some of these ecosystems may be able to also limit future increased moisture stress with climate warming if they are able to support increased evaporative demand by further tapping belowground moisture.","[Fellows, A.

We quantified carbon (C) density in 20 managed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests ranging in age from 5 to 118 years located across the southeastern United States and estimated above-and belowground C trajectories. Ecosystem C stock (all pools including soil C) and aboveground live tree C increased nonlinearly with stand age and the modeled asymptotic maxima were 168 Mg C/ha and 80 Mg C/ha, respectively. Accumulation of ecosystem C with stand age was driven mainly by increases in aboveground live tree C, which ranged from < 1 Mg C/ha to 74 Mg C/ha and comprised < 1% to 39% of ecosystem C. Live root C (sum of below-stump C, ground penetrating radar measurement of lateral root C, and live fine root C) increased with stand age and represented 4-22% of ecosystem C. Soil C was related to site index, but not to stand age, and made up 39-92% of ecosystem C. Live understory C, forest floor C, downed dead wood C, and standing dead wood C were small fractions of ecosystem C in these frequently burned stands. Stand age and site index accounted for 76% of the variation in ecosystem C among stands. The mean root-to-shoot ratio calculated as the average across all stands (excluding the grass-stage stand) was 0.54 (standard deviation of 0.19) and higher than reports for other conifers. Long-term accumulation of live tree C, combined with the larger role of belowground accumulation of lateral root C than in other forest types, indicates a role of longleaf pine forests in providing disturbance-resistant C storage that can balance the more rapid C accumulation and C removal associated with more intensively managed forests. Although other managed southern pine systems sequester more C over the short-term, we suggest that longleaf pine forests can play a meaningful role in regional forest C management.","[Samuelson, Lisa J.; Stokes, Thomas A.; Ramirez, Michael R.; Lewis, John C.] Auburn Univ, Ctr Longleaf Pine Ecosyst, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Butnor, John R.] Univ Vermont, Southern Res Stn, US Forest Serv, USDA,Aiken Ctr, 81 Carrigan Dr,Room 208, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt H.; Anderson, Pete H.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, USDA, 3041 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 28809 USA; [Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.; Martin, Timothy A.; Cropper, Wendell P., Jr.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 110410, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt H.] US Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, USDA, 1577 Brevard Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 USA; [Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, Coll Forestry, 269 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Samuelson, LJ (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Ctr Longleaf Pine Ecosyst, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",samuelj@auburn.edu,"Butnor, John/P-9738-2016; Cropper, Jr., Wendell/E-5952-2010","Butnor, John/0000-0003-0602-3898; Cropper, Jr., Wendell/0000-0001-7851-7382; Martin, Timothy/0000-0002-7872-4194",U.S. Department of Defense through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP)United States Department of Defense,"This research was supported wholly (or in part) by the U.S. Department of Defense through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP).

Previous studies have shown that adding labile carbon can significantly affect the abundance and biomass of various groups of soil animals, including nematodes. However, many studies have used excessive quantities of added carbon and homogenised soil with artificial soil communities. I therefore set up a microcosm incubation experiment with intact soil cores and a natural composition of soil biota to determine the role of low quantities of labile carbon in soil nematodes. Different levels of carbon flow were simulated by a repeated pulse of three glucose concentrations (70, 140 and 350 mu g C g(-1) dry soil week(-1)),which were comparable with the labile carbon supply to the plant rhizosphere. Pure water was added as control. Significant effects were observed in total abundance, microbivorous trophic groups and four nematode genera (Acrobeloides, Plectus, Aphelenchoides and Filenchus). Despite only four genera being affected, their total relative abundance was high and varied from 40% to 70% depending on treatments. The nematode abundance increased in the microcosms, where root exudation was simulated by glucose addition but decreased in the control. Moreover, no major differences in nematode abundance were found among the different quantities of added glucose except for the control. Results demonstrate that easily available carbon in an amount comparable with that found in root exudates is a significant factor that drives soil nematodes, although it has high taxon specificity. Only some genera are sensitive to such carbon applications. The data also suggest that variations in the carbon flow within estimates of root exudation do not cause substantial changes in the number of nematodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We investigated N dynamics across the plant-soil continuum during 6 years of experimental soil warming (2007-2012; +4 degrees C) at a Swiss high-elevation treeline site (Stillberg, Davos; 2180 m a.s.l.) featuring Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata. In the soil, we observed considerable increases in the NH4+ pool size in the first years of warming (by >50%), but this effect declined over time. In contrast, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations in soil solutions from the organic layer increased under warming, especially in later years (maximum of +45% in 2012), suggesting enhanced DON leaching from the main rooting zone. Throughout the experimental period, foliar N concentrations showed species-specific but small warming effects, whereas delta N-15 values showed a sustained increase in warmed plots that was consistent for all species analysed. The estimated total plant N pool size at the end of the study was greater (+17%) in warmed plots with Pinus but not in those containing Larix, with responses driven by trees. Irrespective of plot tree species identity, warming led to an enhanced N pool size of Vaccinium dwarf shrubs, no change in that of Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub) and forbs, and a reduction in that of grasses, nonvascular plants, and fine roots. In combination, higher foliar delta N-15 values and the transient response in soil inorganic N indicate a persistent increase in plant-available N and greater cumulative plant N uptake in warmer soils. Overall, greater N availability and increased DON concentrations suggest an opening of the N cycle with global warming, which might contribute to growth stimulation of some plant species while simultaneously leading to greater N losses from treeline ecosystems and possibly other cold biomes.","[Dawes, Melissa A.; Schleppi, Patrick; Hagedorn, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Dawes, Melissa A.; Rixen, Christian] WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland; [Hattenschwiler, Stephan] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, Univ Montpellier, CEFE,UMR 5175,CNRS, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Dawes, MA (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.; Dawes, MA (reprint author), WSL Inst Snow & Avalanche Res SLF, Fluelastr 11, CH-7260 Davos, Switzerland.",melissa.dawes@wsl.ch,"Schleppi, Patrick/E-6751-2011","Schleppi, Patrick/0000-0002-3578-6563; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988; Dawes, Melissa A./0000-0003-4919-0151; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [315200-116861]; 'ANR-biodiversite' grantFrench National Research Agency (ANR); Velux foundation [371]; WSL; CCES-ETH Project 'MOUNTLAND'; Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research [639, ES1203]; Swiss Federal Office for the Environment","We thank many colleagues at the SLF and WSL for their assistance with field and laboratory measurements and for technical support throughout the soil-warming experiment.

Particularly it examines how the politics of scale in various contexts assists local pragmatic exercises and institutional organizations in building up an age-friendly city (AFC). The functioning mechanisms of glocalization are conceptualized through a triadic framework incorporating structure (mode of local governance), agents, and strategies. The empirical cases examine how AFC has been promoted in Chiayi City of Taiwan and in Hong Kong, the former two Tiger economies. Drawing on a comparative analysis of the two cases, the paper presents three major findings. Firstly, local policy networks are integral to glocalization in that they govern how different resources (i.e., political commitment, professional knowledge, human resources, communication skills, and financial resources) are synthesized under a local institutional framework. Often local policy networks reveal the fragmentation of resources provided by different stakeholders. Secondly, the case study illustrates two different modes of local governance. The Chiayi case reflects an institutionalized governing framework with both hierarchical coordination between levels of state bureaucracies and the horizontal exchange of information and resources between the state and non-state sectors. Hong Kong reflects a grassroots mode whereby the promotion and implementation of AFC initiatives are prompted among NGOs, charities, district councils, and universities. Both modes reveal pros and cons.

Revegetation would be an efficient way to mitigate soil degradation. Some plant and mycorrhizal species are more useful than others for stabilizing soil aggregates and thus reducing erodibility. However, the utility of inoculating plants with mycorrhizas in tropical regions is not clear with regard to the effects on soil aggregate stability. We investigated how plant inoculation with arbuscular (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi could improve aggregate stability of ultramafic Ferralsols in New Caledonia. We performed inoculations with local AMF and ECM on three endemic plant species grown in a glasshouse: the sedge Costularia arundinacea (Sol. Ex Vahl) Kuk., an AMF host, the shrub Tristaniopsis glauca Brongn. & Gris and the tree Arillastrum gummiferum (Panther ex Brongn. & Gris) Baill., the latter species are both ECM hosts. We carried out three treatments for each plant species growing in an ultramafic topsoil, (i) control soil with no plants, (ii) non-inoculated plants and (iii) inoculated plants. Inoculation of C. arundinacea was carried out by adding to the topsoil a suspension of mixed AMF spores. T. glauca and A. gummiferum were inoculated with the ECM fungus Pisolithus microcarpus. After 9-10 months, aggregate stability, soil organic carbon, above- and below-ground dry biomass and root traits were measured. Results showed that on ultramafic topsoil, AMF and ECM inoculations significantly increased plant growth, modified roots (especially root length density) and consequently enhanced aggregate stability. Out of the non-inoculated plant species, C. arundinacea had the greatest positive effect on aggregate stability. The association of T. glauca and P. microcarpus was also found to significantly increase aggregate stability. Thus, the inoculation of native plant species with carefully selected mycorrhizal fungi could be an efficient technique to aid in the revegetation of bare slopes.","[Demenois, Julien; Carriconde, Fabian] Inst Agron Neocaledonien IAC, Equipe Sol & Vegetat SolVeg, BP18239, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Demenois, Julien] AgroParisTech, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rey, Freddy] Univ Grenoble Aipes, Irstea, UR EMGR, 2 Rue Papeterie,BP 76, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Stokes, Alexia] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ird, Inra,Amap, TA A51-PS2, F-34398 Montpellier, France","Demenois, J (reprint author), Inst Agron Neocaledonien IAC, Equipe Sol & Vegetat SolVeg, BP18239, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.",demenois@iac.nc,"Demenois, Julien/P-1020-2019","Demenois, Julien/0000-0002-2271-8465",IAC; IAC [DE2013-041]; Societe Le Nickel (IAC-SLN) [DE2013-041]; Vale NC [E87141/0001]; French Ministry of Agriculture,"We gratefully acknowledge the field staff of IAC ('Unite SARA'): A.

However, to our knowledge, there is currently no comparison of these two methods across different ecosystems. A regression analysis for 8 different soils showed that there were significant linear relationships between PLFA and EL-FAME extracts (r(2) = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.72, respectively) for determining the fungal (18:20)6,9) and bacterial abundance and fungal-to-bacterial ratio (F:B ratio). However, regression lines of forest soils for fungal abundance and F:B ratio had a slight but significantly higher intercept than those of arable soils, i.e. higher EL-FAME:PLFA ratio for fungi in forests than those in arable soils. This might be due to that EL-FAME extracts may have additional factors such as physiological status of fungi and the inclusion of substantial amount of humic substances that affect quantitative determination of fungal biomass. Overall, EL-FAME method is simple and would produce similar results to PLFA method for bacteria in both quantitative and qualitative assessments when comparing different soils across ecosystems. However, for fungi, PLFA method would be more suitable than EL-FAME method.","[Miura, T.; Makoto, K.; Kaneko, N.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Soil Ecol Res Grp, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Niwa, S.] Hokkaido Univ, Tomakomai Expt Forest, Tomakomai, Hokkaido 0530035, Japan; [Sakamoto, K.] Chiba Univ, Dept Hort, Plant Nutr Lab, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan; [Miura, T.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile; [Makoto, K.] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Teshio Expt Forest, Horonobe, Hokkaido 0982943, Japan","Miura, T (reprint author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Soil Ecol Res Grp, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.; Miura, T (reprint author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Campus Isla Teja, Valdivia, Chile.",toshikomiura@uach.cl; makoto@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; sniwa@fsc.hokudai.ac.jp; kaneko-nobuhiro-sw@ynu.ac.jp; ksakamoto@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"Kaneko, Nobuhiro/C-3714-2008; SAKAMOTO, Kazunori/R-8750-2019; Sakamoto, Kazunori/R-8728-2019; Miura, Toshiko/F-7627-2013","Kaneko, Nobuhiro/0000-0002-3804-4151; Sakamoto, Kazunori/0000-0002-8817-814X; Miura, Toshiko/0000-0002-3092-4496","Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S-9]; MEXT KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25220104]; Ministry of Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan","We thank Sachiko Inoue (Kyushu University), Toshihide Hirao (The University of Tokyo), Shigeho Sato (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute), Atsushi Takashima (University of the Ryukyus) and Hiroko Kurokawa (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute) for soil sampling.

Nodules of V. jacquemontii were typical of all other described mimosoid legumes. All 73 of the isolates were strains of Ensifer, and concatenated phylogenetic analysis of their housekeeping genes (rrs, recA, atpD, glnII and dnaK) suggested that they are novel, forming separate lineages close to E. saheli. The phylogenies of the symbiosis-essential genes nodA and nifH were inconsistent with the housekeeping phylogenies. The nodA sequences of most isolates were close to that of E. arboris HAMBI 1552(T), but the nifH gene was found to be related to that of E. kostiensis HAMBI 1489(T). All the tested Ensifer strains, except for AJ24, were found to be capable of nodulating other species of Vachellia as well as native Indian Mimosa and Prosopis spp. Stressful conditions caused by the alkaline soil of the Thar Desert have resulted in V. jacquemontii being nodulated by diverse and promiscuous Ensifer species that are capable of nodulating other native members of the tribe Mimoseae.","[Sankhla, Indu Singh; Tak, Nisha; Meghwal, Raju Ram; Choudhary, Sunil; Tak, Alkesh; Rathi, Sonam; Gehlot, Hukam Singh] Jai Narain Vyas Univ, Dept Bot, BNF & Stress Biol Lab, Jodhpur 342033, Rajasthan, India; [Sankhla, Indu Singh] Univ Rajasthan, Dept Bot, Jaipur 302004, Rajasthan, India; [Sprent, Janet I.] Univ Dundee, James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [James, Euan K.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Gehlot, HS (reprint author), Jai Narain Vyas Univ, Dept Bot, BNF & Stress Biol Lab, Jodhpur 342033, Rajasthan, India.; James, EK (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",euan.james@hutton.ac.uk; hsgehlot@gmail.com,"Tak, Nisha/P-7874-2019; GEHLOT, Hukam Singh/H-7529-2019; James, Euan/K-1135-2012","James, Euan/0000-0001-7969-6570; Gehlot, Hukam/0000-0001-7447-4960; Sankhla, Dr Indu Singh/0000-0001-5131-6345","University Grants Commission (UGC), New DelhiUniversity Grants Commission, India; Department of Biotechnology Govt. of IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) IndiaGovernment of India [BT/PR11461/AGR/21/270/2008]; University Grants Commission (UGC-SAPII-CAS-I, UGC-BSR Start-Up-Grant) [F.30-16/2014]","Indu S.

For the Brazilian semi-arid region, data on genetic variability and symbiotic efficiency of Papilionoidae rhizobial communities are very scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability and the symbiotic efficiency of eight rhizobial isolates obtained from ""mulungu"" (Erythrina velutina Willd.) nodules. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial kit, amplified with universal primers, and subjected to sequencing reactions. For the isolate ESA 71, PCR amplifications for nodC and nodA genes were attempted. Rhizobial efficiency was assessed by two greenhouse experiments. The first assay was carried out under gnotobiotic conditions, with sterile sand as a substrate; the second experiment was conducted in a non-sterile soil. For both experiments, the inoculation treatments consisted of a single inoculation of each isolate, in addition to a treatment with Bradyrhizobium elkanii BR 5609 as a reference strain. Furthermore, two non-inoculated control treatments, supplied and not supplied with mineral N, were also evaluated. Bacterial identification indicated that both alpha and beta-rhizobia could be found in ""mulungu"" root nodules. Three isolates where classified within the Rhizobium genus, four bacteria belonged to Bradyrhizobium and one isolate clustered with Burkholderia. Positive amplification of an intragenic fragment of the nodA gene using a primer set to beta-rhizobia could be found for ESA 71 (Burkholderia). All bacterial isolates were effective in colonizing ""mulungu"" roots. In the first experiment, all inoculated treatments and N fertilization increased the N concentration in ""mulungu"" shoot tissues. For total N in the shoots, the isolates ESA 70, ESA 72, and ESA 75 stood out. In the non-sterile substrate experiment, the isolates ESA 70, ESA 71, ESA 72, and ESA 75, together with the reference strains, induced increases in the shoot N concentration and total accumulation compared to the absolute control. The results indicate that ""mulungu"" is able to establish associations with efficient alpha and beta-rhizobia in Brazilian semi-arid soils.","[Souza Menezes, Kelly Alexsandra] Univ Estado Bahia, Dept Tecnol & Ciencias Sociais, Programa Posgrad Horti Irrigada, Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [Costa Escobar, Indra Elena; Resende Fraiz, Ana Carla] Univ Fed Vale Sao Francisco, Colegiado Farmac, Programa Posgad Recursos Nat Semiarido, Petrolina, PE, Brazil; [Vieira Martins, Lindete Miria] Univ Estado Bahia, Dept Tecnol & Ciencias Sociais, Juazeiro, BA, Brazil; [Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan] Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr, Embrapa Semiarido, Petroiina, PE, Brazil","Fernandes, PI (reprint author), Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr, Embrapa Semiarido, Petroiina, PE, Brazil.",paulo.ivan@embrapa.br,"Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan/M-6706-2017","Fernandes-Junior, Paulo Ivan/0000-0002-6390-3720; Escobar, Indra/0000-0002-1644-682X",CapesCAPES; Embrapa; UNEB; CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [406321/2013-0],"Our thanks to Capes for the scholarships granted to the first three authors, and to Embrapa, UNEB, and CNPq (406321/2013-0) for financial support.",,37,2,2,0,3,SOC BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO,VICOSA,"C P 231, BR-36571-000 VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL",0100-0683,,,REV BRAS CIENC SOLO,Rev.

Herein, we simultaneously quantified N fluxes through precipitation, throughfall, and 0-, 15-, and 30-cm soil solutions, as well as litterfall, in two forests with different soil acidity (Ultisols at the MV village (exchangeable Al3+ in 0-30 cm, 126 kmol(c) ha(-1)) and Oxisols at the AD village (exchangeable Al3+ in 0-30 cm, 59.8 kmolc ha(-1))) over 2 years in Cameroon. The N fluxes to the O horizon via litterfall plus throughfall were similar for both sites (MV and AD, 243 and 273 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Those values were remarkably large relative to other tropical forests, reflecting the dominance of legumes in this region. The total dissolved N flux from the O horizon at the MV was 28 kg N ha-1 yr-1, while it was 127 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) mainly as NO3- -N (similar to 80%) at the AD. The distinctly different pattern of N cycles could be caused by stronger soil acidity at the MV, which was considered to promote a superficial root mat formation in the O horizon despite the marked dry season (fine root biomass in the O horizon and its proportion to the 1-m-soil profile: 1.5 Mg ha(-1) and 31% at the MV; 0.3Mg ha(-1) and 9% at the AD). Combined with the published data for N fluxes in tropical forests, we have shown that Oxisols, in combination with N-fixing species, have large N fluxes from the O horizon; meanwhile, Ultisols do not have large fluxes because of plant uptake through the root mat in the O horizon. Consequently, our results suggest that soil type can be amajor factor influencing the pattern of N fluxes from the O horizon via the effects of soil acidity, thereby determining the contrasting plant-soil N cycles in the tropical forests of Africa.","[Shibata, Makoto; Funakawa, Shinya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Shibata, Makoto; Araki, Shigeru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr African Area Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Sugihara, Soh] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, Tokyo, Japan; [Mvondo-Ze, Antoine David] Univ Dschang, Fac Agron & Sci Agr, Dschang, Cameroon","Shibata, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan.; Shibata, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr African Area Studies, Kyoto, Japan.",makotosbt@gmail.com,"Sugihara, Soh/D-2534-2016","Sugihara, Soh/0000-0002-5874-8957; Shibata, Makoto/0000-0002-7685-8711","JST/JICAJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST); SATREPS; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24255019, 24228007]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [13J06387]","Our work was financially supported by JST/JICA, SATREPS, JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Numbers 24255019 and 24228007), and the JSPS Fellows (Grant Number 13J06387).",,94,4,5,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by Quercus species are critical to human well-being. Thus, it is essential to understand how Quercus species grow and how they will respond to global change. Bringing together data of comparative growth experiments with seedlings, field data and allometric equations developed for adult plants, our main objectives for this chapter are: (1) to quantify the relative growth rates (RGR) and growth components of seedlings of Quercus species and compare them to values of woody species belonging to other families; (2) to characterise biomass allocation patterns in leaves, stem and roots and RGR in Quercus adults; (3) to understand how temperature, precipitation, tree size and tree density affect the RGR of adult Quercus species; and (4) to compare the RGR of seedlings and adults, and identify which functional traits can explain the differences in RGR. Compared to woody species from other families, seedlings of Quercus species were characterized by low RGR and specific leaf area (SLA), a high proportion of biomass invested in roots (RMF, root mass fraction) and a large seed mass. One of the most important traits explaining differences in RGR among seedlings of Quercus species was the leaf area ratio (LAR, total leaf area per unit of total biomass). In Quercus species, the fraction of biomass in leaves (LMF) and roots (RMF) decreased with tree size, while the proportion of biomass in stems (SMF) increased. Thus, for a tree with 20 cm diameter at breast height, the values of LMF were only between 0.01 and 0.05 (i.e. 1-5% of total biomass invested in leaves) and SMF ranged from 0.50 to 0.80. RGR values of adult Quercus species were highly variable, due to differences in tree size, stand density and abiotic factors. Tree size and density negatively affected RGR, so bigger trees tend to grow more slowly. However, the variation in RGR explained by temperature and/or precipitation was relatively low (<7% of total variation). We observed a positive relationship between the RGR of seedlings in controlled conditions and those of adults in the field. Furthermore, median RGR values of adult plants for Quercus species were positively related to SLA and leaf nitrogen. To sum up, Quercus species differ in RGR and key leaf traits from other woody species and the RGR of adult trees depend on tree size, density, temperature and precipitation. Our results suggest that climate change synchronised with density might affect future trends on the growth of Quercus species.","[Villar, Rafael; de la Riva, Enrique G.] Univ Cordoba, Fac Ciencias, Area Ecol, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Poorter, Hendrik] Forschungszentrum Julich, Plant Sci IBG2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Cornelissen, Johannes H.

Despite that exogenous GSH insignificantly promoted Cd uptake by the plant, it could decrease of Cd root-to-shoot transport and ameliorate Cd toxicity to the plant. At 6 mg Cd kg(-1) soil, GSH addition well countered the Cd-induced significant reduction in CAT activity, but only insignificantly decreased MDA content, suggesting exogenous GSH might indirectly protect plant against oxidative stress via regulating antioxidative enzyme activities. However, at 12 mg Cd kg(-1) soil, GSH application insignificantly increased the antioxidant activities but significantly decreased MDA content, indicating external GSH could directly participate in removing radical oxygen species. The results suggest exogenous GSH may have the potential of decreasing Cd accumulation in the edible parts of cultivars and alleviating Cd toxicity.","[Wang, Jun] Liaoning Shihua Univ, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Environm Engn, Fushun 113001, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bin; Chen, Xin; Shi, Yi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Shi, Y (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",shiyi@iae.ac.cn,,,National Science and Technology Infrastructure Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of P.R.

We used soil cores, minirhizotrons and nylon meshes to estimate growth, biomass and distribution of fine roots and fungal hyphae at different soil depths. In control plots fine roots proliferated in upper soil layers, whereas in drought plots there was no fine root growth in upper soil layers and roots mostly occupied deeper soil layers. Fungal hyphae followed the same pattern as fine roots, with the highest biomass in deeper soil layers in drought plots.

They are the most important pathway of plant-derived C into the soil and facilitate most of the N and P uptake. In boreal and temperate forest ecosystems, the subgroup of ectomy-corrhizas is of special significance, and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is obligatory for a number of tree species. These fungal assemblages can be highly diverse, which is often contrasting with the relatively low number of tree species. This is also true for small monoculture stands, where several studies showed dozens of different ectomycorrhizal species. The elemental mechanisms that drive ectomycorrhizal community composition and structure, especially on larger scales, are still subject of debate. In particular, the role and function of most of the rare species remain largely unknown. In this chapter, we investigate the structural traits of ectomycorrhizal communities of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), one of the most important tree species in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. We therefore compiled data from ten different beech dominated sites across a European gradient to seek for ubiquitously valid statements regarding the species composition and community structure of ectomycorrhizae. A total of 205 ectomycorrhizal species were detected, of which 45% and 35% could be identified to the species and genus level, respectively. The majority of them are site-specific and found in very low abundances. A few species with narrow host range such as Lactarius subdulcis, Laccaria amethystina or Lactarius pallidus show low abundances on many sites. Three species, namely Hebeloma sinapizans, Lactarius salmonicolor and Elaphomyces aculeatus, appeared to be very dominant on one respective site. Cenococcum geophilum and Russula ochroleuca, both considered multi-host species, occur at all or rather several sites with relatively high abundances. Species ranking-abundance curves revealed a universal distribution pattern, with few dominant ectomycorrhizal species and a long tail of rare species. This shape is regardless of stand age and management practice, though no statistically significant correlations with species richness and the latter mentioned parameters could be found. By looking at several community structures, we were able to add another dimension of rarity and found most of the species not only being rare at a particular site, but also rare in terms of single appearance across several analysed stands. However, a vast part of ectomycorrhizal fungal species still remains unidentified. This circumstance further impedes our understanding concerning the occurrence of rare species. Yet, understanding their functional behaviour is of particular significance, as they could pose a key factor in ecosystem functioning, especially under changing climatic conditions.","[Rosinger, Christoph; Sanden, Hans; Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Rosinger, C (reprint author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.rosinger@boku.ac.at,,,"Marie Curie grantEuropean Union (EU) [GPF333996 LINKTOFUN]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I [LO1415]","This work was supported by a Marie Curie grant GPF333996 LINKTOFUN to DG, and by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I, grant No. LO1415.",,65,1,1,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-63336-7; 978-3-319-63335-0,SUST PLANT CROP PRO,,,2017,,,,,,,143,156,,10.1007/978-3-319-63336-7_9,,,14,Agronomy; Ecology,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2XZ,WOS:000434216400009,,,,,10/31/19B,"Macek, I",,"Lukac, M; Grenni, P; Gamboni, M",,"Macek, Irena",,,Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Communities Pushed Over the Edge - Lessons from Extreme Ecosystems,SOIL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE,Sustainability in Plant and Crop Protection,,English,Proceedings Paper,3rd Annual Meeting of the COST-Action-FP1305-Biolink on Linking Belowground Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in European Forests,"NOV 17-19, 2015","Rome, ITALY","COST Act FP1305 Biolink, EU Commiss",,Abiotic stress; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Soil biodiversity; Community ecology; Extreme ecosystems; Global change; Glomeromycota; Microbial ecology; Mofettes,MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; COASTAL VEGETATION; SOIL; PLANT; ROOTS; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; SPECIFICITY; ENVIRONMENT; ADAPTATION,"The diversity and structure of soil microbial communities are crucial elements in understanding the ecological impacts of rapidly changing environments. One important group of soil microbes is the ubiquitous plant symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Their diverse communities are shaped by complex interactions of their abiotic and biotic environments. Locally extreme ecosystems have proven to be useful for natural long-term experiments in the ecology and evolution of AM fungi, giving an insight into much-needed processes of adaptation and acclimation of natural communities to abiotic stress. For example, data from natural CO2 springs (mofettes) show that when exposed to extreme long-term stress (soil hypoxia and elevated soil CO2 concentrations) specific and temporary stable AM fungal communities form with a high abundance of specialised, stress-tolerant taxa. Moreover, in both natural-and human-impacted ecosystems there are several such cases. This chapter covers a wide range of extremes (abiotic stresses) in the pedosphere, from high to low temperatures, drought and floods, hypoxia, salinity, and soil pollution. An overview of several specific stressed environments where AM fungal community ecology has been studied is presented. In some of these cases, locally extreme environments have already been used and could further serve as a powerful tool to study slow ecological and evolutionary processes that normally require long-term observations and experiments to study them.","[Macek, Irena] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Macek, Irena] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol FAMNIT, Glagoljaska 8, Koper 6000, Slovenia","Macek, I (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.; Macek, I (reprint author), Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol FAMNIT, Glagoljaska 8, Koper 6000, Slovenia.",irena.macek@bf.uni-lj.si,,,"Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS)Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [J4-5526, J4-7052]; ARRS programme [P4-0085]; Swiss National Science Foundation project SCOPES (Scientific Co-operation between Eastern Europe and Switzerland)","Work supported by the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS), projects J4-5526 and J4-7052, ARRS programme P4-0085, and Swiss National Science Foundation project SCOPES (Scientific Co-operation between Eastern Europe and Switzerland).",,80,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-63336-7; 978-3-319-63335-0,SUST PLANT CROP PRO,,,2017,,,,,,,157,172,,10.1007/978-3-319-63336-7_10,,,16,Agronomy; Ecology,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2XZ,WOS:000434216400010,,,,,10/31/19B,"Blonska, E; Lasota, J",,"Lukac, M; Grenni, P; Gamboni, M",,"Blonska, Ewa; Lasota, Jaroslaw",,,ss-Glucosidase Activity of Forest Soil as an Indicator of Soil Carbon Accumulation,SOIL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE,Sustainability in Plant and Crop Protection,,English,Proceedings Paper,3rd Annual Meeting of the COST-Action-FP1305-Biolink on Linking Belowground Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in European Forests,"NOV 17-19, 2015","Rome, ITALY","COST Act FP1305 Biolink, EU Commiss",,Forest soil; Soil organic matter; Scots pine; Pedunculate oak,ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; LITTER; DECOMPOSITION; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; BACTERIAL; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS; IMPACT,"In this research study, ss-glucosidase activity was used to assess differences occurring in soils as a result of the influence of different tree species. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) on the enzymatic activity of ss-glucosidase, selected biochemical properties, as well as physical and chemical characteristics of soil. Sample plots were located in central Poland, in the Przedborz forest district (51.09.59.50 degrees N, 20.00.24.25 degrees E). The test area was dominated by Cambisols (WRB 2002). Twenty research plots were established: 10 plots under pine and 10 plots under oak. The pH, soil texture, and organic carbon, nitrogen and base cation contents, ss-glucosidase activity, and microbial biomass carbon, respiration were determined in the soil samples. The highest activity of ss-glucosidase in this study was reported in the soils of pine stands. In the case of pine trees, the enzymatic activity is probably due to a simultaneous interaction of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots of pine trees with fungi present in genetic horizons which are rich in acidic decomposition products of organic matter derived from surface humus. The rate of organic substances transformation depends largely on the quality of soil organic matter, which is related to species composition of forest stands. We noted a significant correlation between ss-glucosidase activity and carbon content, C/N ratio and acidity of soil. The profile distribution of ss-glucosidase activity in the estimation of soil profiles decreased rapidly with soil depth.","[Blonska, Ewa; Lasota, Jaroslaw] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Soil Sci, Al 29 Go Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland","Blonska, E (reprint author), Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Soil Sci, Al 29 Go Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",eblonska@ar.krakow.pl,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-63336-7; 978-3-319-63335-0,SUST PLANT CROP PRO,,,2017,,,,,,,253,263,,10.1007/978-3-319-63336-7_15,,,11,Agronomy; Ecology,Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2XZ,WOS:000434216400015,,,,,10/31/19B,"Taketani, RG; Kavamura, VN; dos Santos, SN",,"DeAzevedo, JL; Quecine, MC",,"Taketani, Rodrigo Gouvea; Kavamura, Vanessa Nessner; dos Santos, Suikinai Nobre",,,Diversity and Technological Aspects of Microorganisms from Semiarid Environments,DIVERSITY AND BENEFITS OF MICROORGANISMS FROM THE TROPICS,,,English,Article; Book Chapter,,,,,,Bioproducts; Osmolytes; Drought resistance; Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; Xerophile; Xerotolerant; Thermophile; Thermotolerant,GROWTH-PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PLANT-GROWTH; RHIZOSPHERE SOIL; DROUGHT STRESS; BACTERIAL; AZOSPIRILLUM; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; CAATINGA,"Semiarid environments are characterized by the low water availability throughout the year.

Socioeconomic changes of the past decades have caused a progressive abandonment of the traditional use for grazing of some areas, while grazing pressure at easily accessible grasslands have increased. Here, we analyse the effect of these land-use changes on the factors regulating the soil C accumulation and stocks. Overgrazing generally leads to a reduction above-and below-ground litter inputs and a decrease in soil C stocks, affecting some soil physicochemical and biological properties. Additionally, the labile C inputs coming from animal faeces may accelerate the mineralisation of organic matter. Grazing abandonment causes a reduction of aboveground productivity, but the lack of consumption causes a short-term accumulation of organic matter. Its effect on belowground biomass and productivity is less clear. At longer term, grazing abandonment causes a change in the plant community composition, having the shrub encroachment the strongest effect on C storage. The low biochemical quality of shrub litter delays its decomposition and allows higher organic matter accumulation in the topsoil. But the effect of shrub proliferation at the deeper soil is less clear. The low root turnover of shrubs compared to grasses may reduce the C inputs to the soil. But, at the same time, the reduction of the root exudates may also reduce the microbial activity and the organic matter mineralisation.","[Garcia-Pausas, Jordi; Montane, Francesc; Rios, Ana I.; Taull, Marc; Rovira, Pere; Casals, Pere] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia, CEMFOR CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys,Km 2, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain; [Romanya, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Hlth & Environm, Joan 23 S-N, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Montane, Francesc] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Garcia-Pausas, J (reprint author), Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia, CEMFOR CTFC, Ctra St Llorenc de Morunys,Km 2, Solsona 25280, Catalonia, Spain.",jordi.gpausas@gmail.com,"Casals, Pere/M-2418-2014; Romanya, Joan/K-7714-2014; Garcia-Pausas, Jordi/L-2984-2014","Casals, Pere/0000-0002-0372-988X; Romanya, Joan/0000-0002-4519-9653; Garcia-Pausas, Jordi/0000-0003-2727-3167",,,,111,5,5,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1574-0919,,978-3-319-55982-7; 978-3-319-55981-0,ADV GLOB CHANGE RES,Adv.

However, this method is time consuming and it is often difficult to distinguish between AM and non-AM fungi. In this study, we analyzed the fatty acid profiles in soybean roots colonized by AM fungi to determine if specific fatty acids derived from AM fungi can be used as markers for the intensity of the AM fungal colonization. The wild-type Enrei and hypernodulating Kanto100 soybean cultivars were inoculated with an AM fungus (Gigaspora rosea) alone or with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, which nodulates soybean roots. Fatty acids 20: 1.9, 20: 4.6, and 20: 5.3 were specifically detected in the lateral roots of AM fungus-inoculated and dual-inoculated soybean plants. In the second lateral roots, the percentage of AM-specific fatty acids (i.e., 20: 1.9, 20: 4.6, and 20: 5.3) derived from AM fungi was closely correlated with the intensity of the AM fungal colonization. We propose that the AM-specific fatty acids represent useful markers for estimating the degree of AM fungal colonization. The percentage of AM-specific fatty acids was more than twofold higher in the second lateral roots than in the first lateral roots. Thus, the degree of AM fungal colonization is probably twofold higher in the second lateral roots than in the first lateral roots.","[Sakamoto, Kazunori; Kaji, Tomomitsu] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Matsudo, Chiba, Japan; [Kaji, Tomomitsu] JA ZEN NOH Res & Dev Ctr, Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Japan","Sakamoto, K (reprint author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Hort, Plant Nutr Lab, 648 Matsudo, Matsudo, Chiba 2718510, Japan.",ksakamoto@faculty.chiba-u.jp,"SAKAMOTO, Kazunori/R-8750-2019; Sakamoto, Kazunori/R-8728-2019","Sakamoto, Kazunori/0000-0002-8817-814X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23380042, 16K07637]",This work was partly supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI: [Grant Numbers 23380042 and 16K07637] to K.S.,,36,0,0,2,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

The native AMF species (Funelliformis mosseae, Glomus intradices and Glomus proliferum) at different levels (10, 20 and 50 g inoculum per seedling) were applied to the seedlings raised in polythene bags. Inoculated seedlings showed a significant difference in plant growth and quality when compared to the uninoculated seedlings. Though, the growth and quality enhancement differed among AMF species and levels of inoculation, generally, mycorrhizal symbiosis significantly improved seedling growth. Mycorrhizal colonisation of seedlings roots ranged from 15.0 to 36.0%. The physiological parameters also showed improvement with AMF inoculation. The mycorrhizal efficiency index (MEI) of seedlings inoculated with G. proliferum (50 g inoculum) was 89.23%. Root colonisation was found to range from 17.33 to 33.33% and from 22.67 to 56.33% when 50 g and 10 g of inoculums were used. The result showed that G. proliferum (50 g of inoculums) at the time of transplanting showed maximum growth and seedling quality benefits in nursery as compared to all other fungi used for T. grandis. The technology has potential to reduce the nursery period and increase quality of seedlings produced, resulting in considerable economic gains.","[Ajeesh, R.; Santhoshkumar, A.

A study was carried out to elucidate the effects of four shade periods on biomass allocation, biomass ratio and leaf morphology of N. heimii seedlings, namely 0, 6, 9 and 12 months under shade. Mass of stem, leaf, root and total plant were significantly reduced when the seedlings were grown under full sunlight for 12 months. Under reduced shade period, leaf mass ratio decreased, while root mass ratio and root to shoot mass ratio increased. Morphological properties of the leaf were significantly affected by various shade periods, where leaf area and leaf area ratio values were reduced by removing shade at different periods. Results indicated that N. heimii seedlings could acclimatise to direct sunlight particularly after they had been placed under the shade for 6 to 9 months.","[Sherzad, O. H.; Zaki, H.

Stem temperature (T-s) and R-s declined continuously during the dry period and reached their minimum values in January. Irrigation increased the R-s rate, while drought decreased it. The nitrogen content of the sapwood remained constant until December, after which it decreased when winter began. During the winter, the sapwood nitrogen increased under irrigation but decreased under drought conditions. The soluble sugars tended to increase during the dry period at the cost of starch, which caused a small but non-significant increase in NSCs. The effect of water treatments on total NSCs was limited; however the drought treatments increased the soluble sugars content but decreased the starch content. R-s explained 49, 72 and 40% of the seasonal variation in the stem nitrogen, starch and soluble sugars, respectively. The psi(pd) significantly explained 49, 79 and 85% of the variation in the R-s, stem starch and soluble sugars, respectively. Thus, soil moisture content likely affects R-s by affecting the amount of sapwood nitrogen, starch and soluble sugars. Low soil moisture content induced by drought enhanced the transformation of starch to soluble sugars during the winter, when heartwood formed. These strong relationships may provide interesting implication for future study on heartwood formation.","[Cui, Z. Y.; Yang, Z. J.; Xu, D. P.; Zhang, N. N.; Liu, X.

It has been hypothesized that all cold-adapted plants face similar growth constraints at low temperature mainly associated with the formation of new tissues. To explore the thermal limitation of plant tissue formation, we studied root growth and anatomical root tissue characteristics in four cold-adapted alpine species (Ranunculus glacialis, Rumex alpinus, Tussilago farfara, Poa alpina), grown in thermostated soils with a vertical temperature gradient approaching 1 degrees C. Above-ground plant organs were exposed to typical alpine climate conditions (high solar radiation and cool nights) at 2440 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Alps to assure continuous source activity. Image-based measurements of root growth (root elongation rates at 12-h intervals, RERs) were combined with anatomical examinations in thermally constrained root tips as well as with a functional growth analysis of entire plants. Temperatures in the range 0.8 to 1.4 degrees C were denoted as critically low temperature thresholds for root formation across the four species. The RERs per 12 h revealed that roots kept extending at low rates at 0.7-1.2 degrees C but cell elongation and xylem lignification were clearly inhibited in the terminal zones of root tips. Roots exposed to temperatures between 1 and 5 degrees C showed strongly reduced elongation rates so that these roots contributed very little to the entire root system compared to control roots grown at 10 degrees C. Hardly any secondary roots were formed at temperatures below 5 degrees C and total root mass was substantially lower (74 % reduction in comparison to control), also the above-ground biomass was reduced by 23 %. Cell elongation and differentiation rather than cell division control length and shape of root cells at the low temperature limit of growth. Lignification of root xylem is clearly constrained at temperatures below 3 degrees C.","[Nagelmueller, Sebastian; Hiltbrunner, Erika; Korner, Christian] Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Dept Environm Sci, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; [Nagelmueller, Sebastian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Nagelmuller, S (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Dept Environm Sci, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.; Nagelmuller, S (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",sebastian.nagelmueller@usys.ethz.ch,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014",,"Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel; Crop Science Group of the Polytechnical University (ETH) Zurich","This study was funded by the Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel, and the Crop Science Group of the Polytechnical University (ETH) Zurich.",,42,4,4,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx054,10.1093/aobpla/plx054,,,16,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS2SJ,WOS:000419628500003,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,10/31/19J,"Yamawo, A; Sato, M; Mukai, H",,,,"Yamawo, Akira; Sato, Miori; Mukai, Hiromi",,,Experimental evidence for benefit of self discrimination in roots of a clonal plant,AOB PLANTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Clonal plant; intraspecific competition; invasive species; population growth; root behaviour,GENETIC-STRUCTURE; KIN RECOGNITION; COMMUNICATION; COMPETITION; BEHAVIOR,"Some plants express self discrimination in their roots, which allows them to preferentially reduce antagonistic interactions and increase facilitative interactions with genetically identical ramets or individuals. However, our understanding of how self discrimination contributes to reproduction in plants is limited. Here, we report that self discrimination is adaptive in the clonal plant Kalanchoe daigremontiana. Plants were grown with a self or non-self plant for 30 days. Furthermore, root allocation patterns associated with self and non-self plants and their root exudates were investigated in a split-root experiment. Biomass of shoot, root, and plantlets and number of plantlets per plant were examined. Plants expressed root behaviour that is specific to the non-self condition: plants developed more roots when growing with a non-self plant than when growing with a self plant. Similar root behaviour was observed in the root exudate experiment, in which it reduced both root growth and clonal reproduction in non-self competitor plants. As a result, plants competing with a clonal self plant produced more clonal plantlets than plants competing with a non-self plant. These experimental results provide evidence that self discrimination through root exudation is adaptive for K. daigremontiana plants.","[Yamawo, Akira; Sato, Miori] Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, 1 Bunkyo Cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368560, Japan; [Mukai, Hiromi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Entomol, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan","Yamawo, A (reprint author), Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, 1 Bunkyo Cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368560, Japan.",yamawo.aki@gmail.com,,,"Japanese Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K18611, 15K18618]",This work was supported by Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (no. 15K18611 to A.Y. and no. 15K18618 to H.M.).,,24,6,6,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx049,10.1093/aobpla/plx049,,,7,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FS2SG,WOS:000419628200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Leite, TD; Dombroski, JLD; de Freitas, RMO; Leite, MD; Rodrigues, MRD",,,,"Leite, Tiago de Sousa; Dallabona Dombroski, Jeferson Luiz; Oliveira de Freitas, Romulo Magno; Leite, Moadir de Sousa; de Oliveira Rodrigues, Mara Raquel",,,PRODUCTION OF Enterolobium contortisiliquum SEEDLINGS AND ASSIMILATE PARTITIONING IN RESPONSE TO PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION AND INOCULATION WITH MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI,CIENCIA FLORESTAL,,,Portuguese,Article,,,,,,fertilization; dry matter; leaf area; Dickson quality index,GROWTH; MORONG; L.,"This study aimed to evaluate the production of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.)

The aim of the work was to estimate quantity of aboveground (thin brunches, buds and foliage) and belowground (fine roots) necromass as well as annual input of aboveground and belowground litter. Moreover, to quantify carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content within these compartments. Aboveground litter-fall was collected over five years (2009 - 2013) and annual input of necromass was estimated. At the same time, stocks of fine root biomass and necromass at soil depth 0 - 30 cm were quantified by means of soil coring. Fine root production was measured by in-growth bags. Then fine root mortality was calculated with regard to differences between biomass stocks in consecutive years and annual production. Our study showed that annual aboveground and belowground litter together represented a large proportion of C input (nearly 3.0 t of C ha(-1) per year in beech stand and 2.5 t ha(-1) per year in spruce stand). Aboveground litter accumulated on the ground was significantly larger in spruce than in beech, however there was more aboveground necromass input in the beech stands. This is most likely due to different decomposition rate between the species and also residence time of C in aboveground litter. On the other hand, fine root necromass stock as well as necromass input of fine roots were similar in both species. As for ratio between quantities of fine roots to aboveground parts, higher value was found for necromass input than necromass standing stock in both species. These differences can be explained by faster decomposition of fine root necromass than aboveground necromass.","[Konopka, Bohdan] Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst Zvolen, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia; [Konopka, Bohdan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 176, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic","Konopka, B (reprint author), Natl Forest Ctr, Forest Res Inst Zvolen, TG Masaryka 22, Zvolen 96092, Slovakia.; Konopka, B (reprint author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 176, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",bkonopka@nlcsk.org,,,"Slovak Research and Development Agency in the Slovak Republic [APVV-0268-10, APVV-0584-12, APVV-14-0086]; Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Agriculture, Czech Republic [QJ 1220316]","The research was supported by the projects APVV-0268-10, APVV-0584-12, and APVV-14-0086 from the Slovak Research and Development Agency in the Slovak Republic.

The decomposability of fine roots and their potential to contribute to soil C is partly regulated by their tissue chemical composition. Roots rely heavily on heteropolymers such as suberins, lignins and tannins to adapt to various environmental pressures and to maximize their resource uptake functions. Since the chemical construction of roots is partly shaped by their immediate biotic/abiotic soil environments, global changes that perturb soil resource availability and plant growth could potentially alter root chemistry, and hence the decomposability of roots. However, the effect of global change on the quantity and composition of root heteropolymers are seldom investigated. We examined the effects of elevated CO2 and warming on the quantity and composition of suberin in roots of Bouteloua gracilis (C4) and Hesperostipa comata (C3) grass species at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment at Wyoming, USA. Roots of B. gracilis exposed to elevated CO2 and warming had higher abundances of suberin and lignin than those exposed to ambient climate treatments. In addition to changes in their abundance, roots exposed to warming and elevated CO2 had higher omega-hydroxy acids compared to plants grown under ambient conditions. The suberin content and composition in roots of H. comata was less responsive to climate treatments. In H. comata, alpha,omega-dioic acids increased with the main effect of elevated CO2, whereas the total quantity of suberin exhibited an increasing trend with the main effect of warming and elevated CO2. The increase in suberin content and altered composition could lower root decomposition rates with implications for root-derived soil carbon under global change. Our study also suggests that the climate change induced alterations in species composition will further mediate potential suberin contributions to soil carbon pools.","[Suseela, Vidya; Tharayil, Nishanth] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Pendall, Elise] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Pendall, Elise] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2753, Australia; [Rao, Apparao M.] Clemson Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Rao, Apparao M.] Clemson Univ, Clemson Nanomat Ctr, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Suseela, V (reprint author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",vsuseel@clemson.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1306607, DEB-1021559]; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Agricultural Research Service Climate Change, Soils and Emission Program USDA-CSREES Soil Processes Program - US Department of Energy Office of Science (BER) [2008-35107-18655, DE-SC0006973]","This study received financial support from the National Science Foundation (DBI-1306607) to V.S.

The potted seedlings were grown under three watering regimes. As a result of the applied watering regimes, the predawn water potential (psi(pd)) of seedlings was maintained at about -0.3, -0.9, and -1.6 MPa in control, moderate, and severe water-stress treatments during the experiment, respectively. Drought treatment had significant effects on the morphology and growth characteristics of the clones but had generally insignificant effects on survival and the photochemical activity of photosystem II (PSII). Results obtained from the present study demonstrate that I-214 was the most successful in terms of its higher root/shoot ratio (R-s), maximum fluorescence yield (F-m), maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) values, and lower number of leaves among the examined four poplar clones under drought stress conditions. Consequently, the I-214 poplar clone may have the potential to be used in drought areas.","[Semerci, Akkin; Karahan, F.

The effects of the scion on AM fungi types in the rhizosphere soil of rootstock and the absorption of mycorrhizal root were determined in this study. Composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, soil assessment, spore density, hyphal length density, glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) content in rhizosphere soil, root hair morphology and AM colonisation rate were measured among Kampong' avocado rootstocks grafted with five scions and Kampong' seedling trees. Results showed the main types of AM fungi in avocado seedling trees and trees grafted with five scions were nearly identical. However, the proportion of main genera exhibited differences. In addition, alkali-hydrolysable N, alkali-hydrolysable P and available K in rhizosphere soil, root hair density, AM colonization, spore density, hyphal length and GRSP content suggested the absorption of Kampong' rootstocks grafted with Monroe', Wilson seedless', Hass' and Tonnage' possessed stronger absorption than Kampong' seedling trees because of high AM colonisation and root hair density. This study suggested scions regulated both the AM and root hair development systematically and laid the foundation for future research of AM-enhancing avocado production.","[Shu, Bo; Liu, Liqin; Jue, Dengwei; Wang, Yicheng; Wei, Yongzan; Shi, Shengyou] Chinese Acad Trop Agr Sci, South Subtrop Crops Res Inst, Key Lab Trop Fruit Biol, Minist Agr, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China","Shi, SY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Trop Agr Sci, South Subtrop Crops Res Inst, Key Lab Trop Fruit Biol, Minist Agr, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China.",ssy7299@163.com,,,"Germplasm Resource Protection of Ministry of Agriculture [2016NWB053]; Science and Technology Planting Project of Guangdong Province, China [2016A020208002]","This work was supported by the Germplasm Resource Protection of Ministry of Agriculture [2016NWB053], and Science and Technology Planting Project of Guangdong Province, China [2016A020208002].",,33,1,1,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0365-0340,1476-3567,,ARCH AGRON SOIL SCI,Arch.

Area of study: Centre of the Iberian Peninsula (Guadalajara province). Material and methods: 26 pairs of holm oak stools with different vigour but with similar site and structural characteristics within each pair were selected. Morphological (basal area, number of stools, maximum height) and physiological traits (leaf water potential, stomatal conductance) of the standing stools were assessed. Their aerial and underground parts were extracted and different size fractions of both their above and below-ground biomass were quantified. Linear mixed models were built to test the effect of 'Stool vigour' on the mean behaviour of the measured variables. Additionally, for the aerial part, linear regressions between the weights of the different size fractions and the basal area at breast height were performed using 'Stool vigour' as a fixed factor. Main results: For the same site, root depth, and number and diameter of shoots than good vigour stools, poor vigour stools displayed: lower predawn water potential, greater leaf mass per unit of area; lower total leaf area; lower above-ground biomass (in total as well as per fractions); lower fine roots biomass; lower proportion of leaf biomass and a greater proportion of biomass of both all roots and those with diameter 2-7 cm. Research highlights: The above-ground physiological and morphological characteristics of declined stools are interpreted as poorer adaptation to site conditions. Root system architecture was found to be relevant to explain this behaviour.","[Serrada, Rafael] Soc Espanola Ciencias Forestales, Pza Pablo Iglesias 1, Guadalajara 19001, Spain; [Gomez-Sanz, Valentin; Aroca, Maria J.; Alfredo Bravo-Fernandez, J.; Roig, Sonia] Univ Politecn Madrid, ECOGESFOR, Dept Sistemas & Recursos Nat, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Otero, Javier] Serv Extinc Incendios Ayuntamiento Guadalajara, C Dos de Mayo 1, Guadalajara 19004, Spain","Serrada, R (reprint author), Soc Espanola Ciencias Forestales, Pza Pablo Iglesias 1, Guadalajara 19001, Spain.",rafaelserrada@telefonica.net,"Onaindia, Miren/L-7082-2014","Onaindia, Miren/0000-0003-1040-0131",Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA)Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA) [De.Tall.E: RTA2009-00110-00-00],"This work was performed within the framework of the project 'Dehesas y Tallares de Encina en la Espana mediterranea: propuestas de gestion para la sostenibilidad de dos sistemas forestales paradigmaticos' (De.Tall.E: RTA2009-00110-00-00), supported by the Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA).",,82,1,1,0,9,INST NACIONAL INVESTIGACION TECHNOLOGIA AGRARIA ALIMENTARIA,MADRID,"CTRA CORUNA KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",2171-5068,2171-9845,,FOREST SYST,For.

Root biomass can be specific for individual types of studied forests. Information on the vertical distribution of fine roots is essential in order to obtain unbiased estimates of fine root biomass. The upper 0-10 cm soil layer of both submontaneous evergreen narrow-leaved and semi-deciduous narrow-leaved forests contained the bulk of dry mass of live roots equal to 855 and 657 g m(-2), respectively, representing 76 and 61% of fine live roots recorded in the whole investigated soil profile. Different root distribution was observed in the mangrove forests where a larger amount of live fine roots (393 and 590 g m(-2)) in deeper soil layers (10-25 cm), representing 57 and 65% of fine live roots recorded in the whole soil profile was found. The results showed significant differences in the vertical distribution of fine roots between mangrove and other types of tropical forest.

Resilience of plant communities to invasion by exotic species may depend on the extent to which native and exotic plant performance are mediated by abiotic and biotic components of the soil. We used a greenhouse experiment to compare performance of two native prairie plant species and one exotic species, when grown in intraspecific competition and when each native was grown in interspecific competition with the exotic species, in the presence and absence of a native prairie soil community, and when nitrogen availability was elevated or was maintained at native prairie levels. We found that elevated nitrogen availability was beneficial to the exotic species and had no effect on or was detrimental to the native plant species, that the native microbial community was beneficial to the native plant species and either had no effect or was detrimental to the exotic species and that intraspecific competition was stronger than interspecific competition for the exotic plant species and vice versa for the natives. Our results demonstrate that soil nitrogen availability and the soil microbial community can mediate the strength of competition between native and exotic plant species. We found no evidence for native microbes enhancing the performance of the exotic plant species. Instead, loss of the native soil microbial community appears to reinforce the negative effects of elevated N on native plant communities and its benefits to exotic invasive species. Resilience of plant communities to invasion by exotic plant species is facilitated by the presence of an intact native soilmicrobial community and weakened by anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen.","[Shivega, W.

The objective was to explore how changes in the detritus inputs affect soil organic matter (SOM) composition. The content of SOM fraction has been compared with soil enzyme activities. The investigation was carried out in the Swietokrzyskie Mountains of central Poland. Twenty investigation plots were selected, including fir stands (10 plots) and maple with hornbeam stands (10 plots). Contents of organic C, N and base cations, pH, hydrolytic acidity, and soil texture were investigated. The content of C and N in the physically separated SOM fractions was distinguished. The study indicated only small changes in soil properties and stabilization of organic matter as a result of different detritus inputs. The maple-hornbeam and fir stands have a similar influence on microbiological processes and the SOM. Acidity of soil is a major factor affecting microbial activity and therefore pH affects enzyme dynamics. Differences in soil pH confirmed the stronger acidifying effects of fir stands compared to maple-hornbeam stands. Additionally, fir stands stimulate beta-glucosidase activity, probably through a simultaneous interaction of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots of fir stands.","[Blonska, Ewa; Lasota, Jaroslaw; Gruba, Piotr] Univ Agr, Dept Forest Soil Sci, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland","Blonska, E (reprint author), Univ Agr, Dept Forest Soil Sci, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland.",eblonska@ar.krakow.pl,,,"National Science Centre, Poland [DEC-2011/01/B/NZ9/06879]","This project was financed by the National Science Centre, Poland; Decision No. DEC-2011/01/B/NZ9/06879.",,36,6,7,3,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Because of the genotoxicity describing the composite deleterious action of the toxicants in water, the Vicia faba root-tip cell micronucleus (MN) test was applied for genotoxicity assessment of organic and inorganic substances in four rivers, two lakes and effluent flows from two wastewater treatment plants in Xi'an, China. Results showed that the lowest MN frequency was between 2.0 parts per thousand and 3.0 parts per thousand. However, the highest MN frequency of the water samples was as high as 30.0-34.0 parts per thousand. The results well reflected that the seriously polluted river with high chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon showed high genotoxicity, and also indicated the genotoxic impact of urban discharge on the surface waters and the ability of urban water bodies to absorb the impact. In addition, there were significant correlations between the genotoxicity expressed by MN rate and Cr6+ (5-80mg/L) and phenol concentrations (2-40mg/L). The genotoxicity of the urban water could be quantified as equivalent Cr6+ or phenol concentrations and which might be used as a set of quantitative indicators of the water genotoxicity.","[Liu, Yongjun; Gao, Min; Han, Wei; Liu, Zhe] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Key Lab Northwest Water Resource Ecol & Environm, Minist Educ, 13 Yanta Rd, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Liu, YJ (reprint author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Key Lab Northwest Water Resource Ecol & Environm, Minist Educ, 13 Yanta Rd, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liuyongjun@xauat.edu.cn,,,science and technology industrialization project of Shaanxi Education Department [15JF021]; Project of Science and Technology Benefit Plan [2012GS610203],This study was supported by the science and technology industrialization project of Shaanxi Education Department [grant no. 15JF021] and the Project of Science and Technology Benefit Plan [grant no. 2012GS610203].,,39,0,0,4,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0275-7540,1029-0370,,CHEM ECOL,Chem.

However, estimating BGB is challenging, particularly for forest ecosystems, so robust allometric equations are needed. To obtain such equations for savanna-woodlands of the West African north sudanian zone, we selected four common native woody species (Anogeissus leiocarpa (DC.) Guill. & Perr., Detarium microcarpum Guill. & Perr., Piliostigma thonningii (Schumach.) Milne-Redh. and Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.). At two sites in Burkina Faso, we determined the BGB of 30 trees of each of these species by excavation, and measured various above-ground dimensional variables. The root: shoot ratio varied widely among the species, from 0.1 to 3.4. Depending on the species, allometric equations based on stem basal area at 20 cm height, basal area at breast height and tree height explained 50-95% of the variation in BGB. The best generic equation we obtained, based on basal area at 20 cm, explained 60% of the variation in BGB across the species. Three previously published generic allometric equations underestimated BGB by 8 to 63%. The presented equations should significantly improve the accuracy of BGB estimates in savanna-woodlands and help avoid costly needs to excavate root systems.","[Koala, Jonas; Sawadogo, Louis] CNRST, Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Dept Prod Forestieres, 03 BP 7047, Ouagadougou 03, Burkina Faso; [Savadogo, Patrice] World Agroforestry Ctr & Int Crop Res Inst Semiar, West & Cent Africa Reg Sahel Node, BP 12404, Niamey, Niger; [Aynekulu, Ermias] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya; [Heiskanen, Janne] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 68, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Said, Mohammed] ILRI, POB 30709, Nairobi, Kenya","Koala, J (reprint author), CNRST, Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Dept Prod Forestieres, 03 BP 7047, Ouagadougou 03, Burkina Faso.",ezeyamb@yahoo.fr,"Heiskanen, Janne/K-4668-2019","Heiskanen, Janne/0000-0002-3899-8860","ILRI/BMZ through - Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; CILSS-Carbon project; Robert S.

A part of this study was dedicated to soil analysis, which showed considerable changes in the soil environment and highlighted particularly high concentrations of magnesium and calcium, exceeding optimal limits by as much as 8 and 13 times, respectively. Our results suggest that the decline of evaluated trees is primarily connected to root system development, as we found no differences between evaluated above-ground parameters for either healthy or declining trees. Tree decline related directly to low numbers of skeletal roots, root origin and higher maximal angles between skeletal roots. Declining trees had on average five skeletal roots with maximal angles between them of 173(degrees), indicating poor mechanical stability. Regardless of tree vitality, 93% of all examined root systems were restricted to upper humus horizons with an average rooting depth of 10.2 cm. All evaluated trees showed severe root deformation into tangle, which suggests crucial influence of artificial planting on the architectural development of root systems.","[Albrechtova, Petra; Mauer, Oldrich; Hurt, Vaclav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Silviculture, Brno, Czech Republic; [Gebauer, Roman] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Forest Bot Dendrol & Geobiocoenol, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kacalek, Dusan] Forestry & Game Management Res Inst Jiloviste Str, Forest Res Stn Opocno, Opocno, Czech Republic","Albrechtova, P (reprint author), Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Silviculture, Brno, Czech Republic.",4petraalbrecht@gmail.com,"Kacalek, Dusan/B-6294-2018; Gebauer, R/C-4906-2014","Gebauer, Roman/0000-0001-5661-7585","NAZV (National Agency for Agricultural Research, Czech Republic) [KUS QJ1520080]; Mendel University in Brno [IGA 73/2013]; Indicators of Tree Vitality [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0265]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [10.13039/501100004895]; COSTEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CZ LD14063]; Czech RepublicCzech Republic Government","The research was supported by the project NAZV (National Agency for Agricultural Research, Czech Republic) KUS QJ1520080 ""Optimisation of artificial reforestation in the Czech Republic"", by Mendel University in Brno (grant IGA 73/2013), by the project '''Indicators of Tree Vitality'"" (Reg.

Area of study: Santa Marta Mountain, inside the buffer area of the Los Tuxtlas Biological Reserve in Veracruz (Mexico). Materials and methods: Ten composite samples of rhizosphere soil were collected from L. styraciflua trees of 13-15 cm DBH (diameter at breast height). Roots were fixed in FAA solution to determine the mycorrhizal colonization percentage, the abundance of morphospecies, and its effectiveness in promoting the growth of L. styraciflua, Terminalia amazonia, Cordia alliodora, and Cojoba arborea. Soil physical and chemical characteristics were also analysed, and soil type recognition was performed with the Reference Base for Soil FAO-ISRIC World-SICS. Mycorrhizal colonization was determined by the method of clearing and staining roots with trypan blue; total percentage of colonization was estimated by the Linderman-Biermann method. Spores were extracted for counting and identifying morphospecies from each soil sample, those with more effectiveness were selected and inoculated in the four tree species, based upon a completely random design there were evaluated height, number of leaves, total dry weight and foliar area. Main results: Average mycorrhizal colonization percentage was 45% from natural conditions, samples one and four showed 80% of AMF-colonization. Average number of spores was 617 in 100 g(-1) of dry soil. Forty-seven AMF-morphospecies were identified. After eight months significant differences were observed in root colonization, height, number of leaves, total dry weight, leaf area and foliar analysis of N5+, P5+ and K+ on plants inoculated with rhizosphere samples of L. styraciflua. Terminalia amazonia and Cojoba arborea showed greater response to the inoculation of AMF, they showed more height, number of leaves and more total dry weight; whereas C. alliodora appears to be low dependent on AMF.","[Retama-Ortiz, Yolanda] Inst Tecnol Super Acayucan, Carretera Costera Golfo Km 216-4, Acayucan 96100, Veracruz, Mexico; [Avila-Bello, Carlos H.] Univ Veracruzana, Fac Ingn Sistemas Prod Agr, Carretera Costera Golfo Km 5-5, Acayucan 96000, Veracruz, Mexico; [Alarcon, Alejandro; Ferrera-Cerrato, Ronald] Colegio Postgrad, Postgrad Edafol, Area Microbiol, Carretera Fed Mexico Texcoco Km 36-5, Texcoco 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico","Avila-Bello, CH (reprint author), Univ Veracruzana, Fac Ingn Sistemas Prod Agr, Carretera Costera Golfo Km 5-5, Acayucan 96000, Veracruz, Mexico.",carlavila@uv.mx,,"Alarcon, Alejandro/0000-0002-7212-7751",Direccion General de Investigaciones of Universidad Veracruzana [A0005-DGI-UV]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),Direccion General de Investigaciones of Universidad Veracruzana throughout the grant A0005-DGI-UV.

A two-chambered rootbox separated through 37-m mesh was used to establish the CMN by Diversispora spurca between trifoliate orange (TO) and white clover (WC). After 20weeks of inoculation, the CMN was established, as evident from high mycorrhizal buildup under supplier (mycorrhizal inoculation) TO-target (non-mycorrhizal inoculation) WC association. This CMN was eventually responsible for the significant increase in plant biomass of these associated plants. CMN decreased root abscisic acid (ABA) level in supplier and target plants, but increased root indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level in supplier plant alone. CMN mediated significantly higher gibberellins (GAs) and zeatin riboside (ZR) concentration in roots of target plant, leaving supplier plant unaffected. Root ZR was bidirectionally transferred through the CMN. A higher root methyl jasmonate (MeJA) concentration was observed in supplier WC-target TO or supplier TO-supplier WC association, indicating an unidirectional communication from WC to TO. It suggested that except IAA, GAs, brassinosteroid (BR), and ABA, root MeJA and ZR were apparently involved in the underground communication by CMN.","[Wu, Qiang-Sheng; Zhang, Yi-Can; Zhang, Ze-Zhi] Yangtze Univ, Coll Hort & Gardening, Jingzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qiang-Sheng; Zhang, Yi-Can; Zhang, Ze-Zhi] Yangtze Univ, Inst Root Biol, Jingzhou, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qiang-Sheng] Univ Hradec Kralove, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Srivastava, Anoop Kumar] ICAR Cent Citrus Res Inst, Nagpur, MH, India","Wu, QS (reprint author), Yangtze Univ, Coll Hort & Gardening, Jingzhou, Peoples R China.",wuqiangsheng@yangtzeu.edu.cn,,"Wu, Qiang-Sheng/0000-0002-3405-8409","Plan in Scientific and Technological Innovation Team of Outstanding Young, Hubei Provincial Department of Education [T201604]","This study was supported by the Plan in Scientific and Technological Innovation Team of Outstanding Young, Hubei Provincial Department of Education (T201604).",,45,2,2,4,40,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0365-0340,1476-3567,,ARCH AGRON SOIL SCI,Arch.

The Cd stress reduced the root and shoot growth of sesame, and plant contents of photosynthetic pigments; however, the application of Ca2+ improved these parameters under Cd stress condition. The hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and soluble sugar contents were higher under Cd stress, and were reduced by Ca2+ treatment. The antioxidant enzyme activities in the leaves of sesame, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were higher under Cd stress, whereas reduced concentration was observed in Ca2+-treated plants. Cd stress increased the contents of diacylglycerol and sterol ester; however Ca2+ treatment resulted in a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine. Our results indicated that application of calcium enables sesame plants to withstand the deleterious impact of cadmium through upregulating acquired systemic tolerance system as lipid fractions (galactolipids, phospholipids, neutral lipids), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, APX, GR) hence protect membrane functions.","[Abd Allah, Elsayed Fathi; Alqarawi, Abdulaziz A.] King Saud Univ, Plant Prod Dept, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hashem, Abeer] King Saud Univ, Bot & Microbiol Dept, Coll Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Hashem, Abeer] Agr Res Ctr, Plant Pathol Res Inst, Mycol & Plant Dis Survey Dept, Giza, Egypt; [Wirth, Stephan; Egamberdieva, Dilfuza] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Landscape Biogeochem, Muncheberg, Germany","Abd Allah, EF (reprint author), King Saud Univ, Plant Prod Dept, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",elsayed_22@yahoo.com,"Wirth, Stephan/G-3976-2012; Abd_Allah, elsayed/N-6846-2017; Egamberdieva, Dilfuza/A-1349-2014","Wirth, Stephan/0000-0002-2261-8771; Abd_Allah, elsayed/0000-0002-8509-8953; Egamberdieva, Dilfuza/0000-0001-9811-9277; ALQARAWI, ABDULAZIZ/0000-0002-2027-694X",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud UniversityScience and Technology Development Fund (STDF) [RGP-271],The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for its funding this research group no.

In this sense, the benefits and uses of these microorganisms, and the characteristics of ectomycorrhizae (ECM) are presented herein, which are promising for use in these processes. Also, information on the potential use of ECM for the remediation of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals is presented, as well as some results already searched.

Nevertheless, recent work with some tropical legumes revealed low sensitivity to mineral nitrogen or even enhancement of nodulation by ammonium. Thus, in this study, we investigated plant growth and nodulation of Inga edulis over a period of 128 days using different sources of nitrogen, i.e. ammonium (15 mM), nitrate (15 mM) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Plant growth was evaluated through dry mass, height, stem diameter and root/shoot ratio as well as nodulation by nodule number and dry mass. Nitrate, ureides and total amino acids were determined in roots, shoots and xylem sap. All three nitrogen sources were found to stimulate growth relative to the noninoculated N-free control, however ammonium was the most effective. Nodulation, both nodule number and mass, was strongly reduced by nitrate but not ammonium. The transport of total amino acids in the xylem sap was stimulated by ammonium without change in the composition with asparagine predominating in all treatments. Inga edulis can benefit from fertilisation with ammonium since even at high concentrations growth was improved without impairing nodulation, a condition appropriate for restoration of soil conditions.","[Justino, G.

To maximize this ecosystem service, more knowledge of factors influencing C sequestration is needed. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify recovery of the roots, microbial biomass and composition, and soil structure across a chronosequence of grassland restorations and (ii) use a structural equation model to develop a data-based hypothesis on the relative influence of physical and biological soil properties on the soil C aggregate fraction diagnostic of sequestered C. Belowground plant biomass and tissue quality (C/N ratio), soil microbial biomass C, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations, soil structure, and soil C stocks in the bulk soil and each aggregate fraction were quantified from a cultivated field, prairies restored for 1 to 35-yr (n = 6), and a never-cultivated (native) prairie. Root biomass, microbial biomass C, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) PLFA biomass across the chronosequence increase to resemble native prairie following 35 yr of restoration. Many aspects of soil structure (i. e., bulk density, proportional mass of aggregate fractions, and aggregate mean weighted diameter) and the distribution C among soil fractions, including C in the micro-within-macro aggregate fraction (sequestered C), also became representative of native prairie within 35 yr of restoration. Total soil C stock and physically protected C increased at a similar rate (23 and 27 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) respectively, across the chronosequence. After 35 yr of restoration, 50% of the total C pool was physically protected. The structural equation modeling developed by these data hypothesizes that microbial biomass C and AMF biomass (microbial composition) have the strongest causal influence on physically protected C. This model needs to be tested using independent sites to achieve greater inference.","[Scott, Drew A.; Baer, Sara G.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Scott, Drew A.; Baer, Sara G.] Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Blair, John M.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Scott, DA (reprint author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Scott, DA (reprint author), Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",dascott@siu.edu,"Blair, John/I-4082-2014","Blair, John/0000-0003-0072-0721",Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Program,"This research was funded by the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Program and could not have been accomplished without assistance from T.

In this study, we investigated the hydrological response of a 74-year-old pine plantation forest in southern Ontario, Canada to a selective thinning, wherein 30% of trees were harvested in winter of 2012. Tree-level and ecosystem-level water fluxes were monitored from 2011 to 2013 using sapflow and eddy-covariance techniques, and were compared with an adjacent 39-year-old pine plantation forest that was not thinned. In the 74-year-old forest, transpiration declined after thinning in the 2012 growing season, while tree-level water transport increased despite a severe drought. Time lag between sapflow and ecosystem evapotranspiration showed that the older stand had a significantly shorter time lag when compared to the younger stand, particularly in the thinning year. Linear regression modeling indicated that this was likely due to higher soil moisture status in the older stand versus the younger forest. Hydraulic redistribution of soil water was apparent during drought periods in both forests and did not appear to be negatively affected by the thinning treatment in the older forest. We conclude that selective low density thinning did not negatively impact the forest's response to seasonal drought, and that the availability of more soil moisture as a result of thinning may improve the resilience of the forest to future climatic extreme events such as drought.","[Arain, M.

In this study, Scots pine seedlings were exposed to waterlogging in fine-textured till soil in growth chambers. The treatments started 5 weeks after germination and lasted either for 3 or 8.5 weeks. Three weeks in water-saturated soil affected negatively the root length, root surface area, root volume, the number of root tips, the length of the longest root, root dry mass, the root to shoot ratio, needle water and nitrogen content, and the apoplastic electrical resistance of the stem. The changes by 3 weeks exposure were recoverable since most of the attributes returned to the level of controls when the oxygen content returned to a normoxic level. In contrast, detrimental, but not lethal, effects of water saturation were observed after exposure for 8.5 weeks. Additional effects of prolonged exposure were a decrease in the potential efficiency of photosystem II, the distribution of absorbed light energy between light reactions and the release as heat by chlorophyll fluorescence, and the chlorophyll content index of the needles.

To enhance the accuracy of such estimations, the development of locally not pantropically-derived reliable allometric models is advised whenever possible, especially for dominant and widely distributed tree species, such as in the Castanopsis carlesii H. (C. carlesii) forests in subtropical China. Here, C. carlesii allometric equations were developed and applied to examine for three subtropical forests: a natural primary forest, an artificial-assisted naturally regenerated secondary forest and a C. carlesii plantation. To develop these allometric equations, destructive measurements of architecture and biomass of above- and below-ground components were undertaken for 33 sample trees from 10 dominant species, with stem diameters (at 1.30 m, or above buttresses) ranging from 4 to 67 cm. The mixed-species regressions with only the diameter at breast height as a predictor gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for biomass estimation of foliage, branch and coarse roots; the inclusion of tree height gave the best-fitting allometric relationship for estimation of stem and total biomass. Adding wood density did not improve model performance. Dominant-species regression for C. carlesii was able to predict biomass well using only diameter at breast height as a metric, but adding height and wood density slightly improved the goodness-of-fit, indicating that wood density and tree height may be crucial factors in above- and below-ground biomass models of these subtropical forests. The mixed-species regressions were able to predict well the total biomass of both primary and secondary forests, while the dominant-species models gave a better fit for estimating biomass of the C. carlesii plantation. The biomass estimates of the secondary forest was significantly higher than those of the C. carlesii plantation, indicating that intense forest regeneration practices might cause the reduction of above- and below-ground forest biomass. Therefore, distinct models for the biomass estimation of mixed forests and pure plantation are likely to be needed to improve the accuracy of both biomass assessment protocols and estimations of C sequestration for subtropical forests.","[Lin, Kaimiao; Lyu, Maokui; Jiang, Miaohua; Chen, Yuehmin; Li, Yiqing; Chen, Guangshui; Xie, Jinsheng; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Lin, Kaimiao] Daiyun Mt Natl Nat Reserve Adm Bur, Quanzhou 362503, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Miaohua] Minjiang Univ, Dept Geog, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Li, Yiqing] Univ Hawaii, Coll Agr Forestry & Nat Resources Management, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Xie, JS; Yang, YS (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",jshxie@163.com; geoyys@fjnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013; Lyu, Maokui/X-7226-2018","Lyu, Maokui/0000-0002-9567-2170","National Natural Science Foundation in ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31130013, 31470501, 31370465]","This study was financially supported by the key project of National Natural Science Foundation in China (No. 31130013, 31470501 and 31370465).

However, the degree to which AMF-plant symbioses are locally adapted has been suggested but is less well understood, especially at small spatial scales. Here, we examined the effects of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities on drought tolerance of Themeda triandra, a native African perennial bunchgrass. In our study area, mound building activities of Odontotermes sp. termites produce heterogeneous habitat, particularly with respect to water availability, and do so over small spatial scales (<50 m). Thus, plants and their AMF symbionts may experience identical climatic conditions but very different edaphic conditions. We hypothesized that AMF from off-mound areas, where plants experience drought more intensely than on termite mounds, would confer greater protection from drought conditions than AMF from termite mound soils. To test this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we grew plants in soils that we inoculated with fungi from on or off termite mounds, or with a sterilized control inoculum. Our results reveal habitat-specific AMF effects on host stomatal functioning and growth. Contrary to our expectations, drought stressed grasses inoculated with AMF from termite mounds closed stomata less, and produced 60% more leaves than those inoculated with off-mound AMF, thus exhibiting higher levels of tolerance. Mound-inoculated plants that were drought stressed also produced more than twice as many leaves as non-inoculated plants. Longer-term productivity measurements indicate both on- and off-mound inoculated plants were able to recover to a greater extent than non-inoculated plants, indicating that AMF associations in general help plants recover from drought. These findings highlight the important role that AMF play in mitigating drought stress and indicate that AMF affect how plants experience drought in a small scale, habitat-specific manner.

However, the relative importance of natural enemies in mediating NDD under heterogeneous light conditions has remained unclear. We examined the relative importance of pathogens (i.e., soil pathogens, leaf diseases) on seedling performance in forest understories (FUs) and gaps (gaps) during a 3-year period (results of first year of our study have been previously reported). For the hardwood, Prunus grayana, we investigated seedling mortality, morbidity agents, growth, and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults in FUs and gaps. Seedling mortality was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults throughout 3 years at both sites, mainly due to continuous leaf disease (i.e., angular leaf spot), whereas damping-off diseases caused mortality only in the first year. Beneath each adult, seedling mortality was higher in FUs than in gaps until second year, but it did not differ between two habitat types in the third year, because leaf diseases caused severe damage even in gaps. Seedling mass was significantly lower beneath conspecific adults. AMF infection of seedlings was also lower beneath conspecific adults, while it was higher in gaps than in FUs beneath both adults. This study demonstrates that the J-C model in a hardwood tree, P. grayana is mainly driven by high NDD seedling mortality caused by airborne leaf diseases, which continuously attack seedlings in a NDD manner regardless of environmental light conditions.","[Bayandala; Seiwa, Kenji] Tohoku Univ, Naruko, Miyagi, Japan; [Masaka, Kazuhiko] Hokkaido Forestry Res Inst, Koshunai, Hokkaido, Japan",,seiwa@bios.tohoku.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [23380079]","We are very grateful to two anonymous reviewers, who provided useful comments on the article.

This can be done with root study containers that separate soil into root- and hyphal-zone by a layer of nylon < 30 mu m mesh, which impedes root access to parts of the soil while enabling exploration by AMF (termed the hyphal zone). However, diffusion of P from the hyphal zone to the root zone can complicate the analysis of such experiments when a concentration gradient is created by a P-rich patch in the hyphal zone. This study tested whether a layer of tephra with high P sorption characteristics can be arranged to prevent P diffusion between the root zone and the hyphal zone. A study of P sorption on tephra was conducted to determine the thickness of the tephra needed. Once this was established, the effectiveness of the ""P diffusion break"" in the modified root study container was tested. For this, Lotus pedunculatus cv. barsille was grown in the container having a low-P soil (Olsen P 4.3 mg kg(-1)) in the root zone and either low- or high-P soil (Olsen P 33.3 mg kg(-1)) in the hyphal zone. A 3-mm thick layer of tephra was shown to be adequate to prevent P diffusion for one year from the high-P soil to the low-P soil, as assessed by the absence of P accumulation in resin-P (< 5 mg kg(-1)) and total P in the tephra layer. Plant P uptake was increased by 1.9 mg pot(-1) when AMF could access the high-P soil, resulting in an increase in plant yield by 56 %. Given that (i) P diffusion across the tephra layer was prevented; (ii) roots were confined to the root zone; and (iii) AMF hyphae were detected in the tephra layer, the additional P uptake must have been through AMF acquisition. This experimental design can then be applied to study the influence of soil amendments (e.g. fertilizers, lime, biochar) either containing P or affecting P availability in soil to cause an increasing P transfer by AMF hyphae.","[Shen, Qinhua; Hedley, Mike; Arbestain, Marta Camps] Massey Univ, New Zealand Biochar Res Ctr, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Kirschbaum, Miko U.

The genetic differentiation and gene flow among the chickpea microsymbionts were estimated and considered in view of soil characteristics. A total of nineteen new isolates originating from alkaline-saline (pH 7.9-8.1) soils in Gansu formed two clades by housekeeping gene analyses; clade I (16 isolates) was identified as Mesorhizobium muleiense (97.7-98.7 % of similarities with the type strain CCBAU 83963(T)) and clade II (3 isolates) formed a separate group within Mesorhizobium branch, displaying 97.0 and 96.6 % similarities with the most related type strains M. temperatum SDW 018(T) and M. muleiense CCBAU 83963(T), respectively. Their symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) were highly similar (> 98.0 %) with those described for chickpea microsymbionts in literature, i.e., M. muleiense, M. ciceri, and M. mediterraneum. The genetic differentiation and gene flow between the chickpea rhizobial groups supported our conclusions for species affiliation. M. muleiense and a novel Mesorhizobium genospecies, sharing similar symbiotic genes, are distributed in the alkaline-saline soils of Gansu and may be considered as the main and specific chickpea symbionts in the Northwest of China.","[Zhang, Junjie; Yang, Xu; Guo, Chen] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Coll Food & Bioengn, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan Province, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Environm Pollut Control &, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan Province, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junjie] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Food Prod & Safety Henan P, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan Province, Peoples R China; [de Lajudie, Philippe] IRD, Lab Symbioses Trop & Mediterraneennes, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Singh, Raghvendra Pratap] Shandong Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Microbial Technol, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Entao] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Microbiol, Escuela Nacl Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 11340, DF, Mexico; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenfeng] China Agr Univ, Rhizobium Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",,kirka640@163.com,"de Lajudie, Philippe/B-7460-2008","de Lajudie, Philippe/0000-0002-2196-6352; Wang, En Tao/0000-0001-6606-6916",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400008]; Scientific Research Funds of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry [2014bsjj006];  [SIP20150597],"This work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31400008) and the Scientific Research Funds of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry (Project No. 2014bsjj006).

Only the R. irregularis strain significantly increased the percentage of stable aggregates in both types of soil, being the increases higher in the hyphosphere compartment (on average, about 30 % compared to non-inoculated soil). In the hyphosphere compartment of both soils, the hyphal length developed by plants inoculated with R. irregularis was 81 % greater than that of non-inoculated plants. The effect of the AMF on soil aggregation was mediated by mechanical entanglement of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae but without a contribution of labile carbohydrates.

Many streams have since been restored and our goal was to understand how this affects riparian nitrogen (N) cycling. We compared the natural abundance of delta N-15 isotopes in foliage and roots of Filipendula ulmaria plus soils and litter along streams restored 2-25 years ago. We measured sources of N, potential immobilization of N, namely plant diversity and biomass, and the amount and sources of carbon (C) to determine if these were important for describing riparian N cycling. The delta N-15 of F. ulmaria foliage changed dramatically just after restoration compared to the channelized, disconnected state and then converged over the next 25 years with the steady-state reference. The disturbance and reconnection of the stream with the riparian zone during restoration created a short-term pulse of N availability and gaseous losses of N as a result of enhanced microbial processing of N. With increasing time since restoration, N availability appears to have decreased, and N sources changed to those derived from mycorrhizae, amino acids, or the humus layer, or there was enhanced N-use efficiency by older, more diverse plant communities.","[Hasselquist, Eliza Maher; Nilsson, Christer] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Grp, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Hasselquist, Eliza Maher; Hasselquist, Niles J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Sparks, Jed P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,eliza.hasselquist@gmail.com,,,Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Gustafsson Foundation; Bjorkman Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1137336],"Funding for this work was provided by the Swedish Research Council Formas funded ""RESTORE Project"", Gustafsson's and Bjorkman's Foundations, and NSF award #1137336 Integrated Training in Continental Ecology.

The Thar desert is a sub-tropical desert with infertile, alkaline soils in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, which is home to a large number of legumes that provide food and fuel, or are of medicinal importance to the local people. In the latest in a series of studies on the nodulated legumes of the Thar desert and their associated rhizobia, Sankhla et al. (2016), this issue, have characterised strains of Ensifer rhizobia isolated from nodules of the native mimosoid legume shrub Vachellia (Acacia) jacquemontii. Scope These studies suggest that Ensifer rhizobia are the dominant microsymbionts of legumes native to the Thar desert and are particularly well-adapted to the arid conditions and alkaline soils found there. The Ensifer strains that nodulate V. jacquemontii may constitute a novel species, based on 16S rRNA and Multi Locus Sequence Analysis. Symbiotic adaptation of these rhizobia to local host legumes has involved horizontal gene transfer of symbiosis genes. Conclusions These findings provide further insights into the evolution of legume-rhizobia symbioses and how plants and rhizobia are adapted to and can survive in stressful conditions.","[Ardley, Julie] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia","Ardley, J (reprint author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia.",J.Ardley@murdoch.edu.au,,,,,,28,3,5,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2017,410,2-Jan,,,,,517,520,,10.1007/s11104-016-3125-5,,,4,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,EI3LM,WOS:000392392200039,,,,,10/31/19J,"Umnouysin, S; Sangtiean, T; Poungparn, S",,,,"Umnouysin, Suthathip; Sangtiean, Tanuwong; Poungparn, Sasitorn",,,Zonal distribution of coarse woody debris and its contribution to net primary production in a secondary mangrove forest,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,CWD stock; Mangrove forest; Net primary production; Vegetation zone; Woody debris flux,BROAD-LEAVED FOREST; EASTERN THAILAND; ECOSYSTEMS; STOCKS,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) plays an important role in long-term carbon storage in forest ecosystems. However, few studies have examined CWD in mangrove forests. A secondary mangrove forest on an estuary of the Trat River showed different structures along vegetation zones ranging from the river's edge to inland parts of the forest (the Sonneratia-Avicennia, Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zones, respectively). The mass distribution of CWD stock in downed wood and standing dead trees along these vegetation zones was evaluated. Most of the CWD stock in the Sonneratia-Avicennia and Avicennia zones was found in downed wood, while it mainly accumulated in standing dead trees in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones. The total mass of CWD stock that accumulated in each zone ranged from 1.56-8.39 t ha(-1), depending on the forest structure and inundation regimes. The annual woody debris flux in each zone was calculated by summing the necromass (excluding foliage) of dead trees and coarse litter from 2010 to 2013. The average woody debris flux was 5.4 t ha(-1) year(-1), and its zonal variation principally depended on the necromass production that resulted from forest succession, high tree-density, and lightning. Over all the zones, the above- and below-ground net primary production (ANPP and BNPP, respectively) was estimated at 18.0 and 3.6 t ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The magnitude of BNPP and its contribution to the NPP was markedly increased when fine root production was taken into consideration. The contribution of the woody debris flux without root necromass to the ANPP ranged from 12 to 28%.","[Umnouysin, Suthathip; Poungparn, Sasitorn] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Sangtiean, Tanuwong] Dept Marine & Coastal Resources, Bangkok 10210, Thailand","Poungparn, S (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",sasitorn.p@chula.ac.th,,,Thailand Research FundThailand Research Fund (TRF) [RSA5680017],"We thank the Thailand Research Fund for financial support (Grant No. RSA5680017) and the staff at the Mangrove Research Station at Trat Province, Thailand, for field assistance.

Deposition of carbon (C) from roots and associated biota is the main subsoil C input and inevitable where deep soils coincide with deep rooting. The SOC at depth is characterized by slow turnover times, as environmental conditions in subsoil are less favorable for decomposition, and a range of physical and biological mechanisms stabilize SOC. Thus, subsoil SOC sequestration can contribute to climate change mitigation. However, SOC in subsoil may also respond dynamically on decadal timescales to environmental change, and more research is needed on this poorly understood pool of the contemporary C cycle.","[Lorenz, Klaus; Lal, Rattan] Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Lorenz, K (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Carbon Management & Sequestrat Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,31,1,1,0,0,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,BOCA RATON,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA",,,978-1-351-66656-5; 978-1-4987-8699-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,1614,1617,,10.1081/E-ESS3-120053753,,,4,Soil Science,Agriculture,BM6TI,WOS:000467370700371,,,,,10/31/19J,"Locatelli, T; Tarantola, S; Gardiner, B; Patenaude, G",,,,"Locatelli, Tommaso; Tarantola, Stefano; Gardiner, Barry; Patenaude, Genevieve",,,Variance-based sensitivity analysis of a wind risk model - Model behaviour and lessons for forest modelling,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Method of Sobol; Assessment of model performance; Copula method; Correlated variables,PINUS-PINASTER AIT.; WINDTHROW RISK; ENVIRONMENTAL-MODEL; CONIFEROUS TREES; SITKA SPRUCE; STORM DAMAGE; INDEXES; STANDS; STABILITY; SYSTEMS,"We submitted the semi-empirical, process-based wind-risk model ForestGALES to a variance-based sensitivity analysis using the method of Sobol for correlated variables proposed by Kucherenko et al. (2012). Our results show that ForestGALES is able to simulate very effectively the dynamics of wind damage to forest stands, as the model architecture reflects the significant influence of tree height, stocking density, dbh, and size of an upwind gap, on the calculations of the critical wind speeds of damage. These results highlight the importance of accurate knowledge of the values of these variables when calculating the risk of wind damage with ForestGALES. Conversely, rooting depth and soil type, i.e. the model input variables on which the empirical component of ForestGALES that describes the resistance to overturning is based, contribute only marginally to the variation in the outputs. We show that these two variables can confidently be fixed at a nominal value without significantly affecting the model's predictions. The variance-based method used in this study is equally sensitive to the accurate description of the probability distribution functions of the scrutinised variables, as it is to their correlation structure.

The initial source of energy was fossil fuels that might release some harmful gases. Burning of fossil fuels was practiced since the 18th century, which consequently resulted in 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 according researcher. Presently, the atmospheric level of C is increasing day by day. However, this level would reach similar to 1000 ppm at the end of this century. The consistent discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere is a major threat to global warming; hence, it is important to minimize the atmospheric CO2 by using innovative carbon sequestration technologies. Therefore, soil and water can act as a sink for C storage with the assistance of microorganisms. Here, an attempt is made to discuss these processes in details, interactions between plant and microbes, and the requirement of C sources for C sequestration in the context of climate change. We also conferred about the development of microbial inoculants for C sequestrations and their application for sustainability of agro-ecosystems.","[Oves, Mohammad; Hussain, Fohad M.; Ismail, I. M.

A global light use efficiency model of photosynthesis, coupled with a generic carbon allocation and tree-growth model based on mass balance and tree geometry principles, was used to simulate annual ring-width variations for the gymnosperm Callitris columellaris in the semi-arid Great Western Woodlands, Western Australia, over the past 100 years. Parameter values for the tree growth model were derived from independent observations except for sapwood specific respiration rate, fine-root turnover time, fine-root specific respiration rate and the ratio of fine-root mass to foliage area (zeta), which were calibrated to the ring-width measurements by approximate Bayesian optimization. This procedure imposed a strong constraint on zeta. Modelled and observed ring-widths showed quantitatively similar, positive responses to total annual photosynthetically active radiation and soil moisture, and similar negative responses to vapour pressure deficit. The model also produced enhanced radial growth in response to increasing [CO2] during recent decades, but the data do not show this. Recalibration in moving 30-year time windows produced temporal shifts in the estimated values of zeta, including an increase by ca 12% since the 1960s, and eliminated the [CO2]-induced increase in radial growth. The potential effect of CO2 on ring-width was thus shown to be small compared to effects of climate variability even in this semi-arid climate. It could be counteracted in the model by a modest allocation shift, as has been observed in field experiments with raised [CO2]. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This species is known to suffer from strong intraspecific competition for above-and below-ground resources and recent studies suggest that mixing beech with other species enhances its growth. European Beech is also known to be very sensitive to drought and natural regeneration of this species is therefore threatened under expected climate change scenarios. Whether beech regeneration under future climate conditions could be favoured in mixed forests is still unknown. In the present study, We analysed how species interactions affect the response of beech seedlings to drought. We tested the followings hypotheses: (i) competitor presence and identity impact seedling performance, and (ii) water availability influences the strength and nature of the interactions. In a greenhouse pot experiment, beech seedlings were grown either alone or in the presence of one competitor seedling (beech, sessile oak, Scots pine). A drought treatment was applied to half of the pots and the other half was well-watered. After one growing season, the seedlings were harvested and above- and below-ground growth and functional traits were measured. Under well-watered conditions, functional traits and growth allocation favouring roots indicate that competition occurred mainly for soil resources. Specific fine root length as clearly altered by the presence of pine only, probably through allelopathy or soil acidification. Drought, however, had a strong impact on beech seedling performance whatever the treatment. Drought decreased the importance of negative interactions between seedlings and a positive interaction even occurred between beech and oak. Our results suggest that under the drier climatic conditions expected in the future, naturally regenerating European beech in mixtures with oak may be advantageous for beech seedling survival and growth. In contrast, favouring regeneration or developing plantations which include beech and pine seems less advantageous. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we evaluated how water use strategies can influence the establishment phase of three coexisting species in forests where harvesting intensity and silvicultural interventions have been reduced over recent decades. We conducted a greenhouse experiment between February and July, applying two watering regimes (moist and dry) to current year seedlings in 1.5 m high pots to avoid root growth constraint. At the same time, the physiological performance of seedlings of the same species was monitored under natural conditions in the field over a period of decreasing soil moisture. Our results indicated that resprouter species allocated more than 40% of total biomass to roots whereas the non-resprouter P. pinea allocated only 26%. The plasticity index for the root traits was highest in Q ilex, in which the highest stomatal conductance was measured in early summer. The slowest growth and lowest root plasticity, root hydraulic conductance and leaf water potential were measured in J. oxycedrus. The three species exhibited a positive carbon balance under low water availability. Coexisting species displayed a continuum in the water use strategies adopted. P. pinea would be the least competitive species under the forecasted increasing drought conditions in contrast to J. oxycedrus, which presents traits more suited to coping with droughts.

In a system design environment, where sustainability risk assessment is the focus of the designer, the systematic consideration of sustainability risk during the conceptual design stage is a function of environmental impact of a system. This research paper presents a framework for sustainability risk assessment of a mechanical system at conceptual design stage. The system parameters are identified. These parameters are referred as Sustainability Risk Assessment parameters. Based on the parameters identified, the relationships among these parameters are also identified. These relationships are represented by means of a sustainability risk assessment graph. To avoid complexity of the graph while analyzing the system, it is represented by a matrix, which helps in developing the sustainability risk assessment expression. For analytical assessment, permanent risk function is obtained. Finally, an index is developed for evaluating various mechanical design systems from risk consideration. This framework will help designers while developing mechanical systems at conceptual design stage considering risk through sustainability. The proposed approach has been applied to a material selection case study. The relationships among various sustainability risk assessment parameters are established. Finally graph theory and matrix approach is applied for ranking of various design alternatives from sustainability risk assessment point of view. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified both plant and fungal components of root tips and collected data on abiotic factors that potentially drive variation in ECM fungal community composition. We found that plant host identity and measured abiotic factors explained less than 8% of variation in ECM fungal community composition. ECM fungal community composition did not differ significantly between control and burned/thinned plots; however, it did differ substantially at the tornado-damaged plot, which also exhibited significant spatial structure. These results suggest that much variation in ECM communities is unexplained by commonly measured biotic and abiotic variables and natural disturbance may play a role in both community and spatial structure of ECM fungi.

It can be implemented in yield management of commodities that are harvested its shoot biomass, such as tea or kilemo. This activity interferes plant growth, hence affect root secretion. Consequently, it alters soil microbe populations in the rhizosphere. This paper observes the impacts of pruning on fluctuation of root exudates (soil sugar) and rhizosphere communities of 2-years-old kilemo (Litsea cubeba L. Pers.). Tree samples were pruned by removing shoots above the lowest branches. A month after cutting, trees fertilized using 3 types offertilizers: leaf NPK, and organic fertilizer As a control, there were non-fertilized treated trees. To observe the root exudation and microbes populations, 0-20 cm depth of soil at rhizospheres were collected from 10th, 3 0h, 60 th, and 9 0h day after pruning. Samples were further analyzedfor observing the amount of soil-sugar and microbes population, such as Nfixer cellulose degrader andphosphate solubilizer. Results show that kilemo root drastically decreased their sugar exudation by 22% (1] h day), 28% (30th day), 44% (60th day), and 70% (90th day), respectively. Therefore, those populations were significantly depleted. Rhizosphere sugar can be improved by fertilization, however, the augmentation did not enhance the rhizosphere communities.","[Widyati, Enny] Forestry Res & Dev Agcy, Jl Gunung Batu 5, Bogor 16610, Indonesia","Widyati, E (reprint author), Forestry Res & Dev Agcy, Jl Gunung Batu 5, Bogor 16610, Indonesia.",enny_widyati@yahoo.com,,,R & D Centre for Forest Productivity,Abundant of gratitudes are addressed to R & D Centre for Forest Productivity for providing the research fund.

Given this and its edaphic limitations, it is imperative to better understand these forests ecological patterns of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Therefore, here we compare the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) communities in three treeline Nothofagus pumilio contrasting plots of Chilean Andes (a volcano crater, pristine forest, and disturbed forest). The AM community assemblages were determined by morphological identification and spore counting, in three A horizon soil samples by plot. In the same nine soil samples, standard chemical analysis was performed. Eighteen AM species were described; Acaulospora was the most abundant genus. The forest plot had the highest AM species richness compared to the disturbed and crater plots. Interestingly, soils Olsen P (plant available phosphorus), pH, and Al+++ saturation similarly affected the AM assemblages. We suggest that some AM species could be specially adapted to extremely high Al saturation and extremely low plant available P conditions, as those experienced on Andean Nothofagus forests. These species may help initiate biological succession on highly disturbed ecosystems. We suggest that mycorrhizal fungi play a key role in seedling colonization of extreme environments such as the Andean treeline.","[Marin, Cesar; Godoy, Roberto] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Aguilera, Paula; Cornejo, Pablo] Univ La Frontera, BIOREN UFRO, Ctr Ameliorat & Sustainabil Volcan Soils, POB 54-D, Temuco 4780000, Chile; [Oehl, Fritz] Agroscope, Inst Sustainabil Sci, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Oehl, Fritz] Univ Fed Pernambuco, CCB, Dept Micol, Ave Engn S-N,Cidade Univ 2611606, BR-50740600 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Palfner, Gotz] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Barrio Univ S-N, Concepcion 4030000, Chile; [Boy, Jens] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Soil Sci, Herrenhauser Str 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany","Marin, C (reprint author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Valdivia 5090000, Chile.",cesar.marin@postgrado.uach.cl,"Boy, Jens/B-2926-2018; Cornejo, Pablo E./B-1039-2015; Cornejo, Pablo/N-9694-2019; Marin, Cesar/B-3596-2018","Boy, Jens/0000-0002-2751-957X; Cornejo, Pablo/0000-0003-2124-3100; Marin, Cesar/0000-0002-2529-8929","CONICYT National Doctorate Scholarship [21150047]; FONDECYT projectsComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1141060, 3150175]","We thank Maarja Opik and Emily Giles for their helpful comments regarding this manuscript.

(P. tabulaeformis) is commonly planted in China due to its economic and ecological value. In order to identify one or more ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species for future P. tabulaeformis afforestation, we investigated the effects of five ECM fungal species: Laccaria laccata, Boletus edulis, Gomphidius viscidus, Suillus grevillei, and Suillus luteus on the growth of P. tabulaeformis seedlings under greenhouse conditions. The growth parameters of P. tabulaeformis seedlings were evaluated 90 days following fungal colonisation. The majority of seedlings were significantly affected by ECM inoculation. Mycorrhizal inoculated seedlings were taller, had more lateral roots, and a greater biomass compared with the non-mycorrhizal (CK) seedlings. With the exception of G. viscidus, inoculated seedlings exhibited higher phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen content compared with the CK seedlings. In addition, ECM colonisation increased the enzymatic activity of catalase, acidic phosphatase, protease, and the urease content in the rhizosphere soil. Our study showed that Laccaria laccata, Suillus grevillei, and Suillus luteus may be useful for improving the growth and cultivation of P. tabulaeformis seedlings. Furthermore, we observed that S. luteus inoculation increased the gas exchange parameters of P. tabulaeformis seedlings under field conditions.","[Lu, Nan; Luo, Zijing; Feng, Yue; Cao, Sen; Sun, Yuhan; Li, Yun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Key Lab Genet & Breeding Forest Trees & Ornamenta, Natl Engn Lab Tree Breeding,Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yu, Meng; Cui, Ming] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Li, Y (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Key Lab Genet & Breeding Forest Trees & Ornamenta, Natl Engn Lab Tree Breeding,Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",ln_890110@163.com; carfeild@163.com; cuiming4057@126.com; luozijingbjfu@163.com; vera_keynes@163.com; sailingcs@163.com; syh831008@163.com; yunlil@bjfu.edu.cn,,,Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Program [Z151100002115006]; National Key Basic Research Development Project Program of China [2016YFC0502504]; National Science and Technology Support Program [2012BAC09B03],The authors appreciate the financial support from Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Program (Z151100002115006); the National Key Basic Research Development Project Program of China (No. 2016YFC0502504); National Science and Technology Support Program (No. 2012BAC09B03).,,48,2,2,0,20,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,DEC,2016,7,12,,,,,,,316,10.3390/f7120316,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,EJ6KI,WOS:000393327700014,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"van Putten, IE; Farmery, AK; Green, BS; Hobday, AJ; Lim-Camacho, L; Norman-Lopez, A; Parker, RW",,,,"van Putten, Ingrid E.; Farmery, Anna K.; Green, Bridget S.; Hobday, Alistair J.; Lim-Camacho, Lilly; Norman-Lopez, Ana; Parker, Robert W.",,,The Environmental Impact of Two Australian Rock Lobster Fishery Supply Chains under a Changing Climate,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,climate adaptation; Jasus edwardsii; life cycle assessment ( LCA); Panulirus ornatus; rock lobster fisheries; supply chains,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SEAFOOD AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS; GLOBAL SEAFOOD; MARINE; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTS; FOOD; SUSTAINABILITY; ADAPTATION; FOOTPRINT,"Understanding the potential future impacts of climate change along the supply chain for highly traded fisheries products can inform choices to enhance future global seafood security. We examine the supply chains of the Australian tropical rock lobster fishery (TRL) and southern rock lobster fishery (SRL), with similar destination markets but different catch methods and fishing communities. A boat-to-market analysis allows for comparison and illustration of the effects of single supply-chain aspects. We used life cycle assessment to provide an overview of the environmental footprint, expressed as global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand, for two lobster products: live animals and frozen tails. The export phase contributed 44% and 56% of GWP of live-weight lobster for SRL and TRL, respectively. The SRL fishery currently produces 68% of the combined 1,806.7 tonnes of lobster product and 78% of the combined global warming for the two fisheries over the whole supply chain. We develop climate adaptation options that: (1) reduce the overall footprint; (2) consider alternative supply-chain strategies (e.g., reduce cost); and (3) predicted impact of future climate change. Adaptation options include: more direct export routes and change in the export transport mode. Value adding and product differentiation, which can level out seasonality and thus spread risk, is likely to become increasingly important for both increases and decreases in predicted climate-induced abundance of fish species.","[van Putten, Ingrid E.; Hobday, Alistair J.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Oceans & Atmospher, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Farmery, Anna K.] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Green, Bridget S.; Parker, Robert W.] Univ Tasmania, IMAS, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lim-Camacho, Lilly] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Land & Water, Pullenvale, Qld, Australia; [Norman-Lopez, Ana] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Norman-Lopez, Ana] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium","van Putten, IE (reprint author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Castray Esplanade, GPO Box 1583, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",in-grid.vanputten@csiro.au,"Parker, Robert/J-4476-2012; Lim-Camacho, Lilly/A-7502-2015; Farmery, Anna/H-9696-2014; Hobday, Alistair J./A-1460-2012","Parker, Robert/0000-0003-1910-8081; Lim-Camacho, Lilly/0000-0002-4897-1186; Farmery, Anna/0000-0002-8938-0040; Hobday, Alistair J./0000-0002-3194-8326",FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian GovernmentFisheries R&D Corp [2011/233],This Marine NARP project 2011/233 was supported by funding from the FRDC-DCCEE on behalf of the Australian Government.

As habitat loss threatens to challenge populations of flying squirrels range-wide, wildlife managers and conservationists could benefit from new techniques to survey this nocturnal and secretive species. Here, we developed a novel noninvasive survey technique that combined remote cameras with enclosed bait tubes designed specifically for detecting the presence of flying squirrels. We used this technique to survey for northern flying squirrels throughout their range in Wyoming, USA, from May to October 2012-2014. This technique produce average daily probability detection rates of 54% (SE = 0.02%) with greater rates in the autumn (Aug-Oct). Detection rates varied with length of survey and number of camera stations, providing flexibility for managers to modify survey design depending on project objectives. This technique also nullified the risk of capture myopathy, to which flying squirrels may be susceptible when surveyed using live-trapping methods. Our results suggest that remote cameras combined with enclosed bait tubes can be a cost-efficient and effective tool in assessing and monitoring population trends in occupancy and distribution of northern flying squirrels throughout their range.

However, the ecohydrological and biogeochemical changes associated with this process remain little understood. For more than 3 years, we studied soil moisture dynamics in natural semiarid shrubland patches and compared those with changes in an adjacent site that had been transformed to an exotic buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) savanna. We found that volumetric soil moisture was higher in patches with some kind of cover. For both tree and bare patches, volumetric soil moisture and plant-available water in the 60- to 100-cm depth interval were significantly lower in the savanna than in the natural site. In buffelgrass patches, volumetric soil moisture and plant-available water were higher at almost all depths and in wet years and increased significantly during the summer monsoon season, suggesting rapid infiltration mechanisms under buffelgrass. During years with wet winters, these mechanisms also led to brief accumulations of water in the soil profile (0-200 cm). Such changes in soil profile water dynamics brought about adaptive responses in perennial plant species. The ability of species to change their patterns of soil water use in the profile may be an important mechanism enabling them to compete when novel tree-grass interactions are established by invasion of grasses. Our results provide new insights for understanding the changes caused by grass invasion in arid and semiarid lands, as well as how these changes may impact ecohydrological dynamics in global change scenarios.

The synthesis of root metabolites is a dynamic process that is modulated by interactions with soil microorganisms. This study explored the regulation of soil-borne fungal endophytes and pathogens by the production of phytochemicals in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) roots colonized or not colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Proteins and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals were extracted from chickpea roots and fractionated by flash chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of these metabolites on the soil-borne fungal endophytes Trichoderma harzianum and Geomyces vinaceus and on the pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani were tested in 96-well plate assays. One protein fraction from the AM roots, which contained an apparent 34 KDa chitinase/chitin-binding domain and 24 KDa non-specific lipid transfer protein, non-selectively repressed the fungal endophytes and pathogens. By contrast to the protein fraction, the low-molecular-mass fractions were often selective. Eighteen fractions stimulated specific fungal species and seven fractions inhibited others. Several protein and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals in chickpea roots influence fungal endophytes. The difference in the response of fungal species to the phytochemicals suggests that these metabolites could be involved in the so called host 'preference' of fungal endophytes or 'resistance' to pathogens. This research reveals that the majority of the bioactive root metabolites could be involved in the selective association of chickpea and fungal endophytes while a few compounds provided resistance by suppressing the pathogenic species.","[Bazghaleh, Navid; Hamel, Chantal; Gan, Yantai] Semiarid Prairie Agr Res Ctr, Swift Current, SK S9H 3X2, Canada; [Bazghaleh, Navid; Hamel, Chantal; Knight, J.

Here, we review trends in research on species-(species recognition, phylogenetic relationships, autecology) and community-level AMF diversity patterns and aim to identify ways of improving the complementarity of these approaches. Research into many aspects of AMF diversity has flourished in parallel with the increasing availability of molecular biology techniques. However, despite their shared goal of understanding AMF biodiversity, species- and community-level perspectives, and the morphological and molecular approaches that underpin them, currently have limited capacity for information exchange. We indicate critical research gaps in AMF species and community characterisation and outline important research directions. We propose steps that could link research using different methods and targeting different aspects of diversity, in order to maximise our understanding of AMF.

We used presence/absence data from a recent global survey of AMF communities to assess how often AMF communities differ among plant species, and to explore whether differences result from dissimilarities in AMF taxon identity or richness. We found that AMF communities clustered among plant species in 24% of sites, and that plant species were more likely to differ in AMF taxon richness (23% of sites) than the particular taxa with which they associate (5% of sites). Overall though, the variation in both AMF richness and identity was often as great within as between plant species, suggesting that plant species identity may be less important for structuring local AMF communities than other factors, such as environmental conditions, fungal interactions or even stochastic distributions of AMF. This has implications for how we should view plant-AMF interactions and community patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

At the same time, they raise new questions and challenges. Here, I highlight the most important problems and outline how network tools can be effectively used in mycorrhizal ecology. Network-based tools can be used to explore and visualize mycorrhizal interaction patterns: this can pave the way towards further empirical work and hypothesis testing. However, network-based tools cannot, by themselves alone, provide much insight about the ecological mechanisms driving the establishment of mycorrhizal interactions, because many mechanisms can yield a given network-level pattern. They also cannot help predicting the future dynamics of mycorrhizal communities, because modelling studies need to be conducted using parameters and rules that are relevant to the mycorrhizal symbiosis, which is not currently done. Also, drawing analogies between mycorrhizal networks and other types of networks must be made with caution, taking into account all the potential similarities, but also discrepancies, between these kinds of unrelated networks. I think that keeping the above issues in mind will be critical to keep the network-based approach viable and useful in mycorrhizal ecology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

In this type of mutualism, each host individual can interact with many symbionts, whereas each individual symbiont can interact with only one host individual. Partner choice by the host is a potentially critical mechanism for maintaining such systems; however, its long-term effects on the coevolution between the hosts and symbionts have not been completely explored. In this study, I developed a simple mathematical model to describe the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and symbionts in a one-to-many mutualism. I assumed that each host chooses a constant number of symbionts from a potential symbiont population, a fraction of which are chosen through preferential choice on the basis of the cooperativeness of the symbionts and the rest are chosen randomly. Using numerical calculations, I found that mutualism is maintained when the preferential choice is not very costly and the mutation rate of symbionts is large. I also found that symbionts that receive benefits from hosts without a return (cheater symbionts) and hosts that do not engage in preferential partner choice (indiscriminator hosts) can coexist with mutualist symbionts and discriminator hosts, respectively. The parameter domain of pure mutualism, i.e., free from cheater symbionts and indiscriminator hosts, can be narrower than the whole domain where the mutualism persists.","[Ezoe, Hideo] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan","Ezoe, H (reprint author), Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Naka Ku, 1-1 Gakuen Cho, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan.",hezoe@b.s.osakafu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23570034]",This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI 23570034.,,41,2,2,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1874-1738,1874-1746,,THEOR ECOL-NETH,Theor.

Simultaneously, the composition of soil microbial communities and the abundance of key microbes can influence invasive plant success. Such reciprocal effects may cause plant-microbe interactions to change rapidly during the course of biological invasions in ways that either inhibit or promote invasive species growth. Here we use a space-for-time substitution to illustrate how effects of soil microbial communities on the exotic legume Vicia villosa vary across uninvaded sites, recently invaded sites, and sites invaded by V. villosa for over a decade. We find that soil microorganisms from invaded areas increase V. villosa growth compared to sterilized soil or live soils collected from uninvaded sites, likely because mutualistic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia are not abundant in uninvaded areas. Notably, the benefits resulting from inoculation with live soils were higher for soils from recently invaded sites compared to older invasions, potentially indicating that over longer time scales, soil microbial communities change in ways that may reduce the success of exotic species. These findings suggest that short-term changes to soil microbial communities following invasion may facilitate exotic legume growth likely because of increases in the abundance of mutualistic rhizobia, but also indicate that longer term changes to soil microbial communities may reduce the growth benefits belowground microbial communities provide to exotic species. Our results highlight the changing nature of plant-microbe interactions during biological invasions and illustrate how altered biotic interactions could contribute to both the initial success and subsequent naturalization of invasive legume species.","[Lau, Jennifer A.; Suwa, Tomomi] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.; Suwa, Tomomi] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Lau, JA (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.; Lau, JA (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",jenlau@msu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0918963],"We thank T.

In a restored prairie experiment, we compared high diversity (HD, 25 species) with low diversity (LD, 6 species) prairies to investigate the effect of plant diversity on soil microbial communities and their residues with soil depth. We assayed lipid and amino sugar biomarkers for soil samples, taken after 9 years following the establishment of the prairie treatment, at 5 depth increment layers: 0-2 cm, 12-15 cm, 25-27 cm, 50 52 cm, and 98-100 cm. We found that the microbial biomass and residues decreased considerably with depth in both diversity treatments. Ordination analysis of lipid profiles indicated soil microbial communities were consistently distinct between the deeper and the upper layers, regardless of treatment, and also differed between the LD and HD treatments. Plant diversity effects on soil microbial communities strongly correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as indicated by the lipid marker 16:1 omega 5c. Soil microbial residues in deeper horizons were relatively more enriched in HD than LD treatments, suggesting that greater plant diversity might sustain higher soil carbon storage through relatively recalcitrant necromass inputs in the long term. Decreasing glucosamine/muramic acid (GluN/ MurA) ratio in LD and increasing in HD with depth suggested that the new microbially-accumulated carbon was positively contributed by fungal -derived residues. Our results indicate that plant diversity drives soil microbial carbon sequestration through changes in AMF abundance in restored native tallgrass ecosystems. These findings have implications for understanding how the management of plant diversity can improve soil quality and sustainability in grasslands, and how efforts to conserve and restore diverse grasslands could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

Pb translocation from lower- to higher-order roots was correlated closely with the structural heterogeneity in fine-root architecture. Growing evidence has revealed sexual dimorphism in the aboveground processes of poplars under environmental stresses. However, the belowground performance of poplars has not been well studied to date. Moreover, both structure and function differ markedly among different fine-root orders. Nevertheless, little information is available concerning root branch-specific responses to environmental stresses. In this study, Populus deltoides was employed as a model species to detect sexual differences in root morphology, architecture and metal accumulation under Pb stress. Compared with plants in control conditions, Pb decreased total root length, total surface area, root diameter and biomass, but markedly increased the Pb concentration and accumulation in both sexes. In general, Pb-induced changes in the measured parameters were greater in females than these in males. In contrast to changes resulting from the Pb concentration, root Pb storage was lowest in middle-order roots. Compared to higher root orders, Pb often caused more significant effects on root length, surface area and Pb concentration in lower orders, except for root diameter. The results demonstrate that females are more sensitive to Pb stress than males. In conclusion, males of P. deltoides could concentrate Pb in the roots of lower orders, and suppress transportation of Pb to high order of root. Moreover, negative effects of Pb were generally branch-order specific and Pb translocation was correlated closely with structural heterogeneity in fine-root architecture.","[Xu, Zhenfeng; Chen, Lianghua; Tang, Shishan; Zhuang, Liyan; Yang, Wanqin; Tu, Lihua; Tan, Bo; Zhang, Li] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol Forestry, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China","Xu, ZF; Chen, LH (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol Forestry, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",sicauxzf@163.com; chenlh@sicau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31300513, 31570601]; Eco-environment Monitoring Station of Rainy-Zone of West China","We thank Xiangwei Hu and Mingjin Zhang for help in setting up the experimental facilities, and Yong Peng for help in root measurements.

Although deep rooting is usually considered a drought-tolerant trait, we found that Syringa pinnatifolia, a deep rooting and hydrotropic shrub, has a limited distribution in arid areas. To elucidate the mechanisms for its narrow distribution, we conducted two experiments to examine the physiological and morphological responses to water availability and heterogeneity in S. pinnatifolia and a widespread congeneric species, S. oblata. We measured gas exchange, water use efficiency, and plasticity index in plants of these two species grown at different levels of soil water regimes and in containers with patched water distribution. Our results showed that high photosynthetic capacity in the narrowly distributed S. pinnatifolia was an important factor enabling its survival in the harsh sub-alpine environment. High photosynthetic capacity in S. pinnatifolia, however, was obtained at the expense of high transpiratory water loss, resulting in lower integrative water use efficiency. Biomass allocation to roots in S. pinnatifolia increased by 73 % when soil water increased from 75 to 95 % field capacity, suggesting that S. pinnatifolia could be less competitive for above-ground resources under favorable water regimes. The horizontal root hydrotropism and vertical root hydrotropism of S. pinnatifolia in soil with patched water patterns were likely related to compensation for leaf water loss at low soil water level, indicating a limited capacity for homeostasis within the plant for water conservation and lower level of inherent drought-tolerance. In summary, greater degree of morphological plasticity but lower degree of physiological adjustment may be the main causes for the hydrotropism and narrow distribution of S. pinnatifolia in the sub-alpine habitats.","[Cui, Hongxia; Cong, Shuhua; Hao, Haiping; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Huijin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Cong, Shuhua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 15 Yuquanlu, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xianzhong] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, 723 West Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Li, Zhigang; Hu, Tianhua] Helan Mt Natl Area, 71 Helan Rd, Yinchuan 750200, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yongsheng] Inst Gardening, 13 Xinhua St, Hohhot 010030, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Shi, L (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.; Wang, XZ (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Biol, 723 West Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",xzwang@iupui.edu; shilei@ibcas.ac.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30570175, 31370361]; Knowledge Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of SciencesKnowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-Z-059, KSCX2-EW-B-5, 863-2013AA102903]","This work was financially supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China [30570175], [31370361], and the Knowledge Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-Z-059, KSCX2-EW-B-5], and 863-2013AA102903.",,39,0,0,3,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

This study aimed at assessing the diversity and distribution of AMF in fluvial and maritime dunes, in order to verify if AMF community structure is influenced by physical and chemical soil characteristics. AMF species richness, diversity and community composition, spore density and mycorrhizal colonization were investigated in four natural dunes areas, i.e. two fluvial and two maritime dunes in Bahia State, northeastern Brazil. Soil samples were collected in September 2013 and March 2014. Spore density differed significantly among the dunes and sampling times, with the highest values recorded in the maritime dunes. Fifty-four AMF species were identified in the study areas, of which 51 were identified from field samples and three additional (Acaulospora longula,Acaulospora spinosa and Rhizoglomus natalense) after propagation in trap cultures. The most representative genera were Acaulospora (11), Glomus (10) and Gigaspora (8). Gigaspora margarita was the only species found in all areas at both sampling times, The AMF community composition significantly differed among the four dunes. There was a correlation between the AMF community composition and the soil characteristics. Highest species richness per sample was observed in the areas of maritime dunes. The fluvial and maritime dunes of Bahia showed high diversity of AMF and the soil is an important factor in the structure of the AMF community in sand dunes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of a prescribed fire and subsequent aspen cutting on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow was assessed for the Upper Sheep Creek catchment, a 26-ha headwater catchment dominated by low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, and aspen within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed. The 2007 prescribed fire consumed 100% of the mountain big sagebrush and approximately 21% of the low sagebrush. The aspen, which were mostly untouched by the fire, were cut in the fall of 2008. Post-disturbance ET and vegetation recovery were related to the loss of rooting depth. ET recovered within 2 years on the low sagebrush area with limited rooting depth, while that on the deeper-rooted mountain big sagebrush area took 4 years to recover. ET from the aspen trees, which can sprout from existing roots, recovered within 2 years. The influence of vegetation disturbance on streamflow was assessed using both empirical time trend analysis and process-based modelling. Although both approaches suggested approximately a 20% increase in streamflow during the 6 years post-disturbance, results from the empirical time trend analysis were marginally significant (p = 0.055), while those from the process-based modelling were not statistically significant. Marginal streamflow response can be attributed to rapid post-disturbance recovery of the aspen where most of the streamflow originates. Published 2016.

Because snow insulates soils from frigid winter air temperatures, soils are expected to become colder and experience more winter soil freeze-thaw cycles as snow cover continues to decline. Tree roots are adversely affected by snowpack reduction, but whether loss of snow will affect root-microbe interactions remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to distinguish and attribute direct (e.g., winter snow- and/or soil frost-mediated) vs. indirect (e.g., root-mediated) effects of winter climate change on microbial biomass, the potential activity of microbial exoenzymes, and net N mineralization and nitrification rates. Soil cores were incubated in situ in nylon mesh that either allowed roots to grow into the soil core (2mm pore size) or excluded root ingrowth (50m pore size) for up to 29months along a natural winter climate gradient at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH (USA). Microbial biomass did not differ among ingrowth or exclusion cores. Across sampling dates, the potential activities of cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase, and net N mineralization rates were more strongly related to soil volumetric water content (P<0.05; R-2=0.25-0.46) than to root biomass, snow or soil frost, or winter soil temperature (R-2<0.10). Root ingrowth was positively related to soil frost (P<0.01; R-2=0.28), suggesting that trees compensate for overwinter root mortality caused by soil freezing by re-allocating resources towards root production. At the sites with the deepest snow cover, root ingrowth reduced nitrification rates by 30% (P<0.01), showing that tree roots exert significant influence over nitrification, which declines with reduced snow cover. If soil freezing intensifies over time, then greater compensatory root growth may reduce nitrification rates directly via plant-microbe N competition and indirectly through a negative feedback on soil moisture, resulting in lower N availability to trees in northern hardwood forests.","[Sorensen, Patrick O.; Templer, Pamela H.; Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Christenson, Lynn] Vassar Coll, Dept Biol, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA; [Duran, Jorge] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Funct Ecol, Coimbra, Portugal; [Fahey, Timothy] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Fisk, Melany C.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Groffman, Peter M.] CUNY, Adv Sci Res Ctr, Brooklyn Coll, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Morse, Jennifer L.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Sorensen, PO (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",patsoren@bu.edu,"Sorensen, Patrick/K-1401-2017","Sorensen, Patrick/0000-0002-0558-2789; Fisk, Melany/0000-0003-4248-0180; Morse, Jennifer/0000-0001-8872-4940; Duran, Jorge/0000-0002-7375-5290","Boston University Biogeoscience Program; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 140621, DEB 0949636]; U.S. Department of Energy to ACF [10-DOE-1053]; Fulbright Fellowship of the Spanish Ministry of Education; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","We thank Don Buso and Tammy Wooster for collecting winter snow and soil frost depth measurements for this study.

This study developed techniques to visualize early infection of kauri by PTA in deliberately inoculated seedlings. Conventional light microscopy was carried out on cleared and stained roots using trypan blue to observe PTA structures. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the PTA root structures at a higher resolution. A fluorescent in situ hybridization assay (FISH) was developed using a PTA-specific probe to label PTA structures in planta. Infection progression in roots of 2-year-old kauri inoculated with PTA at 5, 10, 16 and 20 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.) was compared using these three approaches. Light microscopy identified no Phytophthora-like structures in the control treatments. In PTA-inoculated plants, lignitubers were produced 5 d.p.i. in cortical cells. Infection was localized after 5 days, but as the infection progressed (up to 20 d.p.i.), the 'degree' of root infection increased, as did the number of replicates in which structures were observed. SEM provided higher resolution images; again, no PTA structures were observed in the negative control material examined. The slide-based FISH-specificity assay successfully hybridized with PTA hyphae. Fluorescence was observed using 330-380 nm excitation and an emission filter at 420 nm (DAPI), with PTA nuclei fluorescing a bright greenish-yellow. Cross-reactivity was not observed when the assay was applied to six other non-target Phytophthora species. Successful hybridization reactions occurred between the primer and PTA structures in planta. Applying this FISH assay has allowed clear differentiation of the intracellular and intercellular structures of PTA. The technique can be applied to longer term studies or analysis of ex situ inoculation studies aiming to elucidate differential host-responses to the pathogen. Additionally, the technique could be applied to study the interactions with other fungal endophytes (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi), which could be assessed for biocontrol potential as part of the integrated management of the disease.","[Bellgard, S.

Richness of AMF taxa is a strong driver of plant diversity and productivity, thus providing a rationale for characterizing AMF diversity in natural ecosystems. Consequently, a large number of molecular studies on AMF community composition are currently underway. Most published studies, at best, only address species or genera-level resolution. However, several experimental studies indicate that variation in plant performance is large among plants colonised by different individuals of one AMF species. Thus, there is a potential disparity between how molecular community ecologists are currently describing AMF diversity and the level of AMF diversity that may actually be ecologically relevant. We propose a strategy to find many polymorphic loci that can define within-species genetic variability within AMF, or at any level of resolution desired within the Glomermycota. We propose that allele diversity at the intraspecific level could then be measured for target AMF groups, or at other levels of resolution, in environmental DNA samples. Combining the use of such markers with experimental studies on AMF diversity would help to elucidate the most important level(s) of AMF diversity in plant communities. Our goal is to encourage ecologists who are trying to explain how mycorrhizal fungal communities are structured to take an approach that could also yield meaningful information that is relevant to the diversity, functioning and productivity of ecosystems.","[Sanders, Ian R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rodriguez, Alia] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Ciudad Univ, Bogota, Colombia","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",ian.sanders@unil.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",Swiss National Science Research [310030B_144079],We acknowledge financial support from a Swiss National Science Research Project (Bonus of Excellence 310030B_144079) and the University of Lausanne (Cassava Proof of Concept Project) that allowed the development of these ideas.

Agave seedlings were inoculated and kept under greenhouse conditions for 300 days. At 90, 180 and 270 days after inoculation, the number of leaves and plant height were recorded; at the end of the experiment, fresh and dry weight, head (also known as heart or pina) diameter, leaf area and root length and volume were recorded. The percentage of mycorrhizal colonization, the relative mycorrhizal dependency index and the Dickson index were also calculated. Results showed a growth-promoting effect on agave plants when inoculated with native consortia, namely Barranca de las nueces, El Limon, Agua Dulce and Huizachal, compared to the control. Colonization values were high (45%) and similar to those reported in other studies with agaves. Plants inoculated with the Huichazal consortium obtained the highest Dickson index (9.6). It can be concluded that native consortia are a feasible alternative for use as growth promoters in Agave inaequidens and that they can be a good option as biofertilizer sunder nursery conditions.","[Esmeralda Quinones-Aguilar, Evangelina; Cristina Montoya-Martinez, Amelia; Rincon-Enriquez, Gabriel] Ctr Invest & Asistencia Tecnol & Diseno Estado Ja, Guadalajara 44270, Jalisco, Mexico; [Cristina Montoya-Martinez, Amelia; Lobit, Philippe; Lopez-Perez, Luis] Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Agr & Forestales, Tarimbaro 58880, Michoacan, Mexico","Lopez-Perez, L (reprint author), Univ Michoacana, Inst Invest Agr & Forestales, Tarimbaro 58880, Michoacan, Mexico.",lexquilax@yahoo.com.mx,,"Montoya-Martinez, Amelia Cristina/0000-0003-3351-3104; RINCON ENRIQUEZ, GABRIEL/0000-0001-7594-6077",FOMIX Michoacan-CONACYT [MICH-2010-C01-148208]; Coordinacion de la Investigacion Cientifica (CIC) of UMSNH; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),The authors are grateful to FOMIX Michoacan-CONACYT (MICH-2010-C01-148208) and Coordinacion de la Investigacion Cientifica (CIC) of UMSNH for funding this project.

Consequently, locally coevolved symbiotic traits would be well matched in similar environments, but mismatched elsewhere. In a classic mutualistic tradeoff, rhizobia provide nitrogen (N) to legume host plants in return for photosynthates. Despite earlier predictions, there is little evidence so far that spatial differences in soil N content mediate the coevolutionary outcome of the legume-Rhizobium mutualism. To test the existence of such selection mosaics, different genotypes of Vicia cracca and Rhizobium leguminosarum originating from spatially and environmentally highly differentiated sites were cross inoculated across different soil N regimes. In accordance with theoretical predictions, we found highly significant effects of genotype by genotype by environment (G x G x E) interactions, on both nodulation and plant growth, even when R. leguminosarum genotypes showed high genetic similarity. Our results show that the trajectory of the coevolutionary interactions between rhizobia and legumes is differentiated across different environments, and that selection mosaics may play an important role in shaping differences in the genetic composition of rhizobial populations.","[Van Cauwenberghe, Jannick; Visch, Wouter; Honnay, Olivier] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, BE-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Van Cauwenberghe, Jannick; Michiels, Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Microbial & Plant Genet, Leuven, Belgium","Van Cauwenberghe, J (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, BE-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",jannick.vancauwenberghe@bio.kuleuven.be,"Michiels, Jan/F-1601-2010","Michiels, Jan/0000-0001-5829-0897; Visch, Wouter/0000-0003-4291-6239",KU Leuven Research Fund (Program Financing Eco- and Socio-Evolutionary Dynamics),"We acknowledge financial support by the KU Leuven Research Fund (Program Financing Eco- and Socio-Evolutionary Dynamics).

Here, we assessed how drought-induced changes in root systems of four common grassland species affected C and N availability in soil. We hypothesized that drought would promote resource-conservative root traits such as high root tissue density (RTD) and low specific root length (SRL), and that these changes would result in higher soil N availability through decreased root N uptake, but lower C availability through reduced root exudation. We subjected individual plants to drought under controlled conditions, and compared the response of their root biomass, root traits, and soil C and N availability, to control individuals. Drought affected most root traits through reducing root biomass. Only SRL and RTD displayed plasticity; drought reduced SRL, and increased RTD in small plants but decreased RTD in larger plants. Reduced root biomass and a shift towards more resource-conservative root traits increased soil inorganic N availability but did not directly affect soil C availability. These findings identify mechanisms through which drought-induced changes in root systems affect soil C and N availability, and contribute to our understanding of how root traits modify soil processes in a changing world.","[de Vries, Franciska T.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Brown, Caley; Stevens, Carly J.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","de Vries, FT (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",franciska.devries@manchester.ac.uk,"de Vries, Franciska/D-3041-2009","de Vries, Franciska/0000-0002-6822-8883; Stevens, Carly/0000-0002-2390-1763",European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; EUEuropean Union (EU) [264465]; BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L02456X/1],"This work was supported by the European Commission's FP7 programme, EU-project 'EcoFINDERS' No. 264465.

Here, we ask how maintenance costs vary for populations native to contrasting habitats and whether maintenance cost remains constitutive or induced in response to stress. Two populations of Quercus ilex were selected in southern Iberian Peninsula, one growing close to the altitudinal limit and the other growing at mean elevations for the species. Maintenance respiration, growth, and structural variables were measured in leaves and fine roots. We modelled the results found here and those published for populations native to stressed (both soil and latitudinal) habitats. The maintenance respiration measured at 20 A degrees C was higher in expanding (90 %) and in mature (35 %) leaves and in roots (78 %) of individuals growing at higher elevations. Furthermore, our meta-analysis supports that the cost of organ maintenance is higher in stressed habitats, irrespective of the stress factor. As regards the whole plant metabolic design, Q. ilex seems to combine high phenotypic plasticity according to current growth conditions, and high adaptive capacity for local differentiation in response to average stress conditions in the provenance habitat.","[Laureano, Raquel G.; Garcia-Nogales, Ana; Seco, Jose I.; Linares, Juan C.; Martinez, Feliciano; Merino, Jose] Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain","Merino, J (reprint author), Univ Pablo Olavide, Dept Phys Chem & Nat Syst, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",jamerort@upo.es,"Merino, Jose/R-9664-2019; Seco, J.I.

To clarify the mechanism of cerium (Ce) toxicity on Allium sativum, the effects of Ce(IV) on mitosis in root tip cells and physiological responses were studied. Roots growth, mitosis, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde contents, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase were measured after treatments with Ce(IV). Lower Ce concentrations (0.4 and 4 mu M) increased leaf chlorophyll content and enhanced SOD and catalase activities. Higher Ce concentrations (40 and 100 mu M) decreased chlorophyll content and inhibited root growth, but enhanced malondialdehyde contents and catalase and APX activity in roots and leaves. SOD activity was inhibited after 12 days of treatment with 100 mu M Ce. Treatment with > 100 mu M Ce caused chromosomal aberrations (e.g., sticky chromosomes, chromosomal fragments, and bridges) in root tip cells. Chromosomal aberrations in root cells induced by high Ce concentrations might be associated with inhibition of root growth. Changes in antioxidant enzyme activities suggested that Ce(IV) induced antioxidative stress responses and that Ce(IV) treatment first damaged root cells and subsequently affected physiological processes in leaves.","[Xu, Qiu-Man; Wang, Ya-Zhe; Liu, Hui] Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Anim & Plant Resistance, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qiu-Man; Cheng, Jing-Sheng] Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Syst Bioengn, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qiu-Man; Cheng, Jing-Sheng] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Cheng, JS (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Syst Bioengn, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.; Cheng, JS (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",jscheng@tju.edu.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB745100]; Natural Science Foundation of TianjinNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin [13JCYBJC25500]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [21576201],"The authors are grateful to the financial support from the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2014CB745100), the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (13JCYBJC25500), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program: 21576201).",,75,4,5,2,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2016,409,2-Jan,,,,,447,458,,10.1007/s11104-016-2978-y,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,EF0RZ,WOS:000390034900031,,,,,10/31/19J,"Li, WB; Wu, JB; Bai, E; Jin, CJ; Wang, AZ; Yuan, FH; Guan, DX",,,,"Li, Weibin; Wu, Jiabing; Bai, Edith; Jin, Changjie; Wang, Anzhi; Yuan, Fenghui; Guan, Dexin",,,Response of terrestrial carbon dynamics to snow cover change: A meta-analysis of experimental manipulation (II),SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Review,,,,,,Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Microbial biomass carbon; Organic carbon; Snow manipulation; Soil respiration,SOIL RESPIRATION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ORGANIC-CARBON; FROZEN SOIL; FINE ROOTS; WINTER; METHANE; CO2; FLUXES; GROWTH,"Snowpack in winter is very sensitive to climate change, and may in turn induce complex effects on terrestrial biochemistry processes. Here we synthesized the results from 49 papers based on snow depth manipulation experiments and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the general response of 9 variables related to terrestrial carbon pools and dynamics to the altered snowpack depth. Our meta-analysis results indicated that increasing snowpack depth significantly increased litter biomass (+18.4%), MBC (+18.2%) and CO2 emission (+15.5%), and significantly decreased litter C: N ratio (-5.8%) and total soil carbon (-28.5%) under snow addition manipulation, but did not significantly affect fine root biomass, MBC: MBN ratio and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, increasing snowpack depth only significantly altered litter C: N ratio (+11.2%) under snow removal manipulation. The different responses between snow addition and removal were possibly related to the higher soil temperature and moisture under snow addition than under snow removal manipulation experiments. In addition, the effect of increasing snowpack depth on CH4 flux was not significant, presumably because all these studies were compiled from snow-removal experiments.

We found a significant influence of environmental factors (soil pH and organic carbon or land use) on the community composition, but these factors did not fully explain the overall amount of AMF diversity. Geographical distance of sites also significantly affected community structure, indicating significant dispersal limitations of Glomeromycota at the European scale. Indicator species have been proposed by land use and physicochemical soil parameters. Generalist species were also identified, that were found occurring in a large proportion of the sample sites. By co-occurrence analysis of species pairs we show that, at this spatial scale, closely-related species are more likely to co-occur than distantly-related ones. This suggests that environmental filtering is a more dominant driving force in community assembly than fungal competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Afforestation and reforestation are major strategies for global climate change mitigation. Different tree species composition can induce diverse changes in soil CO2 emission and soil carbon sequestration in tree plantation. This study employed three plantations of monoculture and mixed Pinus yunnanensis and Eucalyptus globulus to estimate the effect of tree species composition on soil CO2 emission and soil organic carbon storage in subtropical China. We found that tree species composition had a significant effect on the soil CO2 emission and soil organic carbon storage. Soil CO2 emission was lower in the mixed plantation than in the P. yunnanensis plantation, whereas it was higher than in the E. globulus plantation. Differences in soil CO2 emission among the three plantations were determined by leaf litterfall mass, fine root biomass, soil available nitrogen, pH, soil bulk density, and soil C:N ratio. Soil organic carbon storage was 34.5 and 23.2 % higher in the mixed plantation than in the P. yunnanensis and E. globulus plantations, respectively. Higher soil organic carbon stock in the mixed plantation was attributed to lower C/N ratio of leaf litter and soil, greater fine root biomass and soil organic carbon content, and lower soil CO2 emission. We conclude that mixed tree plantation can enhance soil carbon sequestration, but can decrease or increase soil CO2 emission through altering litter and root inputs and soil physiochemical properties.","[Wang, Shaojun; Wang, Hong; Li, Jihang] Southwest Forestry Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Bailongsi 650224, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaojun] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Wang, SJ (reprint author), Southwest Forestry Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Bailongsi 650224, Kunming, Peoples R China.; Wang, SJ (reprint author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shaojunwang2009@163.com,,,National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41461052]; China 948 Program of National Forestry Bureau [2015-4-39]; Fund Project to Start Science Research in Southwest Forestry University [111206],"This research was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (41461052), China 948 Program of National Forestry Bureau (2015-4-39), Fund Project to Start Science Research in Southwest Forestry University (111206).",,62,2,2,10,74,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Bud set and lammas (second bud flushing) phenology may strongly influence growth, physiology, and biomass in trees. To test effects of these phenological events, 54 individuals from 16 genotypes of black cottonwood poplar (Populus trichocarpa) were grown in a potted trial under greenhouse conditions (with extended daylengths promoting growth), followed by open-air cultivation (with natural daylengths promoting bud set and/or lammas). Trees were monitored for phenology, repeatedly measured for photosynthesis-related traits, harvested for biomass, and assessed for growth partitioning (separating above- and belowground parts). We grouped trees by phenology for comparisons: (1) trees with early summer bud set, (2) trees with early summer bud set that underwent lammas, (3) trees with late summer bud set (August), and (4) trees with bud set occurring in autumn (September). We found that bud set timing positively affected growth partitioning where earlier bud set resulted in shorter trees with higher root:shoot biomass ratios (by increasing root mass). Lammas growth altered these ratios by significantly increasing shoot growth relative to belowground growth. Trees with bud set occurring in late summer also had higher root:shoot biomass ratios (by increasing root mass) compared to trees setting bud in autumn. Occurrence of bud set coincided with modified physiology of the existing canopy where photosynthesis-related traits were enhanced relative to trees still actively growing. These physiological changes were unaltered by occurrence of lammas. This suggests that bud set prompts a significant, coordinated mechanism of higher carbon gain physiology and belowground biomass accumulation in plants within a ""post-bud set"" phase.","[McKown, Athena D.; Guy, Robert D.; Quamme, Linda K.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Forest Sci Ctr, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","McKown, AD (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Forest Sci Ctr, Fac Forestry, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",admckown@gmail.com,,"McKown, Athena/0000-0002-7402-9952",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC Canada) Discovery Grant to R.D.G.

This legume establishes a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which can be used to improve the quality of pastures. However, there are few studies about the diversity and symbiotic efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in Stylosanthes plants. Therefore, the objective was to isolate, characterize and evaluate the symbiotic efficiency of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in symbiosis with Stylosanthes in savanna areas in Roraima, Brazil. Plants with nodules were collected at 6 sites, including cultivated and native areas of the savanna. Shoots of Stylosanthes with flowers were collected to prepare exsiccatae for species identification. The nodules were surface-sterilized with 5% sodium hypochlorite after the roots were washed, and isolation and morphological characterization were performed in 79 culture medium. The isolates were selected according to their morphology, the representativeness of each collection site and the associated Stylosanthes species. Representative isolates were tested for nodulation in cowpea plants, and the isolates able to nodulate the gene 16S rRNA was sequenced. The symbiotic efficiency was evaluated in Stylosanthes capitata cv. Lavradeiro in greenhouse conditions for 65 days. A total of 504 nodules were collected, from which 258 pure isolates were obtained from 5 species of Stylosanthes (S. capitata,S. scabra, S. gracilis, S. humilis and S. angustifolia). The isolates showed significant phenotypic diversity, and 89 isolates were selected. Thirty-one isolates were confirmed to be nodulating bacteria in cowpea plants. These isolates were identified as alpha-Proteobacteria, with Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium genera, and beta-Proteobacteria, with Burkholderia and Herbaspirillum genera. When evaluated in S. capitata, treatment with two Bradyrhizobium isolates, ERR 1178 and ERR 942, resulted in significant production of plant biomass production and N accumulation. These results indicated that a large diversity of alpha-Proteobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria are able to nodulate Stylosanthes spp. and some isolates have potential for testing under field conditions.

Irrigation and fertilization are common management practices in plantations in semiarid regions. However, quantitative investigation of the integrative effect of surface drip irrigation and fertigation (SDIF) on biomass and C storage in poplar plantations remains limited. In this study, we conducted a field experiment on a fast-growing poplar cultivar (Populus x euramericana cv. Guariento) plantation to compare the combination of surface drip irrigation and fertigation in growing seasons with conventional management (control; CK). Experiments repeated over 2 years showed that SDIF significantly increased biomass and C storage in both trees and soil in the plantation compared with the CK. Tree biomass C in SDIF-treated and CK stands after the first year of the experiment (age 5) was 6.20 and 4.05 t C ha(-1), respectively, and the difference further increased, i.e., 15.18 and 8.63 t C ha(-1), respectively, after the second year of the experiment (age 6). There was 53 and 76 % higher C storage in SDIF-treated trees than in the CK trees after the first and second years of the experiment, respectively. The SDIF increased the soil C concentration, especially in the surface soil at 0- to 40-cm depth. Soil organic C at a depth of 0-60 cm under the SDIF treatment was 45.42, 50.87 and 61.32 t C ha(-1) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years, respectively, with annual increases of 12 and 21 % between the first and second, and second and third year, respectively. The corresponding soil organic C in the CK was 43.08, 43.57 and 47.92 t C ha(-1) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years; the annual increases were only 1 and 10 %, respectively. The results confirmed the significant effect of the combined management on C storage in poplar plantations, thus we suggest it can be applied in forestry management, even though it generally did not change C concentrations of tree components.","[Yan, Xiao-Li; Dai, Teng-Fei; Jia, Li-Ming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Dehai] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Jia, LM (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, 35 East Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",jlm@bjfu.edu.cn,,,Special Fund for National Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201004004]; Open Fund of the Beijing Forestry University '985' Advantage Subject Innovation Platform for Research on High Quality and Efficient Silviculture and Management techniques [000-108003],"This research was jointly supported by the Special Fund for National Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Interest (201004004), and the Open Fund of the Beijing Forestry University '985' Advantage Subject Innovation Platform for Research on High Quality and Efficient Silviculture and Management techniques (000-108003).",,75,3,5,0,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

We sampled 10 eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Finland and 10 in Denmark to explore seagrass carbon stocks (C-org stock) and carbon accumulation rates (C-org accumulation) in the Baltic Sea area. The study sites represent a gradient from sheltered to exposed locations in both regions to reflect expected minimum and maximum stocks and accumulation. The C-org stock integrated over the top 25 cm of the sediment averaged 627 g C m(-2) in Finland, while in Denmark the average C-org stock was over 6 times higher (4324 g Cm-2). A conservative estimate of the total organic carbon pool in the regions ranged between 6.98 and 44.9 t C ha(-1). Our results suggest that the Finnish eelgrass meadows are minor carbon sinks compared to the Danish meadows, and that majority of the C-org produced in the Finnish meadows is exported. Our analysis further showed that >40% of the variation in the C-org stocks was explained by sediment characteristics, i.e. dry density, porosity and silt content. In addition, our analysis show that the root : shoot ratio of Z. marina explained >12% and the contribution of Z. marina detritus to the sediment surface C-org pool explained >10% of the variation in the C-org stocks. The mean monetary value for the present carbon storage and carbon sink capacity of eelgrass meadows in Finland and Denmark, were 281 and 1809 EUR ha(-1), respectively. For a more comprehensive picture of seagrass carbon storage capacity, we conclude that future blue carbon studies should, in a more integrative way, investigate the interactions between sediment biogeochemistry, seascape structure, plant species architecture and the hydrodynamic regime.","[Rohr, Maria Emilia; Bostrom, Christoffer] Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Engn Environm & Marine Biol, Artillerigatan 6, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Rohr, Maria Emilia; Holmer, Marianne] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Canal-Verges, Paula] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, Danish Shellfish Ctr, Oroddevej 80, DK-7900 Nykobing, Denmark","Rohr, ME (reprint author), Abo Akad Univ, Fac Sci & Engn Environm & Marine Biol, Artillerigatan 6, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland.; Rohr, ME (reprint author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",mrohr@abo.fi,"Bostrom, Christoffer/U-6679-2017; Holmer, Marianne/M-6989-2014","Bostrom, Christoffer/0000-0003-2845-8331; Holmer, Marianne/0000-0002-6095-5488",Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [201600125]; University of Southern Denmark,This work is part of a double degree programme between Abo Akademi University (AAU) and the University of Southern Denmark (SDU).

Furthermore, the study assessed whether organic chelants could reduce oxidative stress, and thus enhance growth of spinach plants under 2.42 and 4.83 mM Pb regimes. Different organic chelates viz. ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid, (EDTA), citric acid (CA), oxalic acid (OA), tartaric acid (TA) and malic acid (MA) were applied separately in addition to control (without chelating agents) under different Pb regimes. The low (2.42 mM) Pb regime increased biological yield (kg ha(-1)). All the chelates except OA increased biological yield under low Pb regime. In contrast, TA caused less decrease in biomass under high (4.83 mM) Pb regime. The chelate-assisted rise in the antioxidant activities substantially contributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) neutralization. Of the chelates, TA was the most effective in improving Pb uptake and its root to shoot translocation. Overall, the chelate-assisted buildup of Pb in the spinach did not exhibit inhibitory effects on the plant growth possibly due to their potential to decrease Pb-induced oxidative damage. The results elaborated the potential of TA in increasing root to shoot translocation of Pb, biomass, and thus suggested its use for phytoextraction of Pb using spinach in Pb contaminated environments.

The enrichment of the substrate composition with fine charcoal for seedling production of these trees is interesting for increasing soil porosity, water retention and the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms. Experiments were carried out to analyze the effect of substrate enrichment with charcoal on the quality of Clitoria fairchildiana, Enterolobium schomburgkii and Inga edulis seedlings. The treatments consisted of a 3:2:0.5 (v:v) mixture of clay soil, sand and bovine manure and a 3:2 (v:v) mixture of clay soil and sand combined with charcoal rates of 0,10,19 and 29%. After mixing the components, substrate samples were collected and chemically analyzed. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 10 replications. The seedlings were inoculated with homologues rhizobia and growth controlled monthly. The plants were collected to determine the number of nodules and dry biomass of roots, shoots and nodules. Seedling growth was similar on substrates containing charcoal or manure, except for E. schomburkii, which increased by more than 100% on the charcoal-containing substrates. The number and dry biomass of nodules in the charcoal-containing substrates was up to 100% and 300% higher than in the manure-containing treatment, respectively. The results indicated that the substitution of manure by charcoal favors the seedling quality of the studied species.","[de Freitas, Aroldo Felipe] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Florestas Tropicais, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Gomes de Souza, Luiz Augusto] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Cardoso, Irene Maria] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Solos, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Venturin, Nelson] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Ciencias Florestais, Lavras, MG, Brazil","de Freitas, AF (reprint author), Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Florestas Tropicais, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",afelipefreitas@yahoo.com.br; souzalag@inpa.gov.br; irene@ufv.br; venturin@dcf.ufla.br,,,,,,26,0,0,0,7,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",0100-6762,,,REV ARVORE,Rev.

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations. To our knowledge, this study is the first application of 454 pyrosequencing and T-RFLP to characterize and compare multiple sugar beet samples.

To date, the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizae in C sequestration potentials in tropical montane forests have not been clearly investigated. This study determined the amount of C stocks in the different decomposing layers of forest floor, mainly litter, hemic and sapric materials. The abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonisation differed among forest floor fractions. Forest floor was measured for depth, area density, dry mass and carbon fraction separately in Sungai Kial Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia to calculate C stocks. Percentages of root colonisation in the hemic and sapric materials were investigated. The results showed that forest floor C stocks were significantly higher in hemic (5 Mg C ha(-1)) and sapric (7.7 Mg C ha(-1)) compared with the litter fragments (1.5 Mg C ha(-1)). Mycorrhizal root colonisation was significantly higher (75%) in the toeslope compared with the summit area in the hemic materials.

By applying C-13-labeled Tabebuia heterophylla leaves and N-15-labeled Andropogon glomeratus grass, we investigated resource utilization by three earthworm species (invasive endogeic Pontoscolex corethrurus, native anecic Estherella sp., and native endogeic Onychochaeta borincana) and their effects on soil C and N dynamics in Puerto Rican soils in a 22-day laboratory experiment. Changes of C-13/C and N-15/N in soils, earthworms, and microbial populations were analyzed to evaluate resource utilization by earthworms and their influences on C and N dynamics. Estherella spp. utilized the C-13-labeled litter; however, its utilization on the C-13-labeled litter reduced when cultivated with P. corethrurus and O. borincana. Both P. corethrurus and O. borincana utilized the C-13-labeled litter and C-15-labeled grass roots and root exudates. Pontoscolex corethrurus facilitated soil respiration by stimulating C-13-labeled microbial activity; however, this effect was suppressed possibly due to the changes in the microbial activities or community when coexisting with O. borincana. Increased soil N mineralization by individual Estherella spp. and O. borincana was reduced in the mixed-species treatments. The rapid population growth of P. corethrurus may increase competition pressure on food resources on the local earthworm community. The relevance of resource availability to the population growth of P. corethrurus and its significance as an invasive species is a topic in need of future research.","[Huang, Ching -Yu; Hendrix, Paul F.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Huang, Ching -Yu] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Dahlonega, GA 30597 USA; [Gonzalez, Grizelle] US Forest Serv, USDA, Int Inst Trop Forestry, 1201 Ceiba St, Rio Piedras, PR 00926 USA","Huang, CY (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.; Huang, CY (reprint author), Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Dahlonega, GA 30597 USA.",ching-yu.huang@ung.edu; ggonzalez@fs.fed.us; hendrixp@uga.edu,,"Gonzalez, Grizelle/0000-0003-3007-5540","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0236276]; Graduate Student Research Prize, Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Processes, University of Georgia; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0218039]; USDA Forest Service-IITF as part of the LTER program in the Luquillo Experimental Forest","We thank the staff at the Sabana Field Research Station and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) for their help in the lab and in the field.

However, RLD measurements involve destructive and time-consuming sampling. Since plant species richness, functional diversity and functional composition are expected to affect RLD through either non-additive diversity effects or biomass ratio effects, we evaluated whether these measures can be used as a proxy for RLD in levee grassland communities. Location: Levee grassland communities, Scheldt estuary, northern Belgium. Methods: We assessed the strength of correlation between empirically quantified RLD and species richness, functional diversity and functional composition of levee grasslands. More specifically, we used nine below-ground and ten above-ground plant traits retrieved from public databases, and applied linear regressions and partial least square regressions. Results: Plant functional diversity was a better proxy for RLD than plant species richness, with better predictive performance for below-ground than for above-ground traits. More specifically, the highest predictive power was achieved through integration of functional diversity, functional composition and species richness. This suggests that variation in RLD is driven by a combination of both non-additive diversity effects and biomass ratio effects. Conclusions: This study provides a first positive indication of the value of plant functional traits retrieved from databases to predict RLD for river levee grasslands. Furthermore, although less reliable than below-ground traits, above-ground traits are still useful for RLD prediction when information on below-ground traits is lacking.","[Helsen, Kenny; Honnay, Olivier] Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Helsen, Kenny] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Vannoppen, Wouter; Poesen, Jean] Univ Leuven, Div Geog & Tourism, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium","Helsen, K (reprint author), Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.; Helsen, K (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",kenny.helsen@ntnu.no; wouter.vannoppen@kuleuven.be; olivier.honnay@kuleuven.be; jean.poesen@kuleuven.be,"Helsen, Kenny/D-7759-2015","Helsen, Kenny/0000-0001-6856-7095",University of LeuvenKU Leuven [PDMK/13/ 093],"This manuscript was written while K.H. and W.V. held research grants at the University of Leuven (PDMK/13/ 093 and FLOF, respectively).

Root tensile strength is crucial for the enhancement of soil shear resistance by vegetation. In this study, using Betula platyphylla as the model species, we focused on the mechanisms by which loading rate, root gauge length, and diameter affected single-root tensile strength. This study involved factors influencing root tensile strength including root diameter, gauge length, and loading rate, as well as root moisture content. The results demonstrated that (1) loading rate had little influence on root tensile strength as a whole; (2) using the roots in gauge length of 50 mm (2 in) as examples, the effect of root diameter on tensile strength was Significant at the loading rate of 10 mm min(-1) (0.4 in min(-1)), but was minor at the rates of 100 and 200 mm min(-1) (3.4 and 7.8 in min(-1)); (3) gauge length and root tensile strength showed a significant negative linear correlation but with high variability; (4) root diameter and tensile strength showed a negative power function correlation; (5) the increase of loading rate reduced the effect of diameter On tensile strength; and (6) the difference in root weight within one month was not significant, and we therefore ignored the effect of moisture content on root mechanical characteristics.

Five young spruce trees (Picea abies) were pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-13 and the isotopic label was traced in soil invertebrates during 5 weeks. The freshly fixed plant carbon quickly entered both litter-located and soil-located compartments of the detrital food web. Among invertebrates inhabiting the mineral soil layers, a trophic link to the root-derived C was most pronounced in species with higher delta N-15 values, suggesting this energy source to be more important in deeper mineral soil horizons. The label appeared faster in saprophagous animals than in predators (the median time lag after labeling was 6 and 12 days, respectively), but the difference was not significant. The label was recovered in 15 of 38 species of saprophagous animals and in 20 of 63 species of predators. Among saprophages, the frequency and intensity of the label was relatively high in endogeic collembolans and in bibionid larvae, but earthworms and enchytraeids were not labeled. Several groups of predators, lithobiid centipedes in particular, quickly acquired the root-derived carbon, possibly indicating the feeding on live roots or mycorrhizal mycelium. In total, only 35 % of species or genera examined acquired the label. This suggests that majority of invertebrate taxa in the decomposer food web are unlikely to depend heavily on freshly fixed plant carbon provided by roots and root-associated microorganisms.","[Goncharov, Anton A.; Tsurikov, Sergey M.; Potapov, Anton M.; Tiunov, Alexei V.] AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut RAS, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Tsurikov, Sergey M.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Leninskie Gory 1-12, Moscow 119991, Russia","Tiunov, AV (reprint author), AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut RAS, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.",a_tiunov@mail.ru,"Goncharov, Anton/N-6993-2016; Potapov, Anton/M-2370-2016; Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013","Potapov, Anton/0000-0002-4456-1710; Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-01023],"We are most grateful to the staff of Chernogolovka Biological Station for the help in logistics and organization of the experiment.

Theory predicts the erosion of adaptive genetic variation on a within-population level, but considerable genetic diversity is often found locally. Genetic diversity could be expected to be maintained within populations in temporally or spatially variable conditions if genotypic rank orders vary across contrasting microenvironmental settings. Taking advantage of fine-resolution environmental data, we tested the hypothesis that temperature heterogeneity among years could be one factor maintaining quantitative genetic diversity within a natural and genetically diverse plant population. We sampled maternal families of Boechera stricta, an Arabidopsis thaliana relative, at one location in the central Rocky Mountains and grew them in three treatments that, based on records from an adjacent weather station, simulated hourly temperature changes at the native site during three summers with differing mean temperatures. Treatment had a significant effect on all traits, with 2-3-fold increase in above- and belowground biomass and the highest allocation to roots observed in the treatment simulating the warmest summer on record at the site. Treatment affected bivariate associations between traits, with the weakest correlation between above- and belowground biomass in the warmest treatment. The magnitude of quantitative genetic variation for all traits differed across treatments: Genetic variance of biomass was 0 in the warmest treatment, while highly significant diversity was found in average conditions, resulting in broad-sense heritability of 0.31. Significant genotype x environment interactions across all treatments were found only in root-to-shoot ratio. Therefore, temperature variation among summers appears unlikely to account for the observed levels of local genetic variation in size in this perennial species, but may influence family rank order in growth allocation. Our results indicate that natural environmental fluctuations can have a large impact on the magnitude of within-population quantitative genetic variance.","[Salmela, Matti J.; Ewers, Brent E.; Weinig, Cynthia] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Ewers, Brent E.; Weinig, Cynthia] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Weinig, Cynthia] Univ Wyoming, Dept Mol Biol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Salmela, Matti J.] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Vantaa, Finland","Salmela, MJ (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",mattijsalmela@gmail.com,"Ewers, Brent E/A-9696-2008","Ewers, Brent/0000-0001-6647-7475",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1025965],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: IOS-1025965",,69,2,2,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

To allow only hyphae to grow in and to prevent root penetration, paired root exclusion compartments (RECs) were used in experiments 2 and 3, which were either rotated (interrupted mycelium connection) or kept static (allows mycorrhizal connection). After harvesting, seed viability, soil water content, soil phosphorus availability, soil pH, and hyphal length in RECs were measured. In experiment 1, we used inoculation or not with the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis to establish the mycorrhizal treatment levels. A significant negative effect of mycorrhizal hyphae on viability of seeds was observed in experiments 1 and 3, and a similar trend in experiment 2. All three experiments showed that water content, soil pH, and AMF extraradical hyphal lengths were increased in the presence of AMF, but available P was decreased significantly. Viability of seeds in the soil seed bank correlated negatively with water content, soil pH, and AMF extraradical hyphal lengths and positively with soil P availability. Our results suggest that AMF can have a negative impact on soil seed viability, which is in contrast to the often-documented positive effects on plant growth. Such effects must now be included in our conceptual models of the AM symbiosis.","[Maighal, Mahmood; Salem, Mohamed; Kohler, Josef; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Plant Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Maighal, Mahmood; Salem, Mohamed; Kohler, Josef; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Plant Ecol, Berlin, Germany.",matthias.rillig@fu-berlin.de,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Kohler, Josef/0000-0003-0329-3032",Freie Universitat Berlin,Study partially supported by Freie Universitat Berlin.,,56,2,2,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

As a result, it is unclear how the seasonal timing, or phenology, of root C allocation is affected by the phenology of its component processes: growth of root tissue, respiration, mycorrhizal allocation, and exudation of labile C. The objective of this study was to estimate the phenology and partitioning of C belowground across the growing season in a midlatitude forest located in central Massachusetts. Fine and coarse root production, respiration, and exudation were summed to estimate a monthly total belowground C flux (TBCF) in two hardwood stands dominated by Quercus rubra and Fraxinus americana, respectively, and one conifer stand dominated by Tsuga canadensis. We observed significant stand-level differences in belowground C flux and the partitioning of C to root growth, mycorrhizal fungi, exudation, and respiration. The deciduous hardwood stands allocated C belowground earlier in the season compared to the conifer-dominated stand. The deciduous stands also allocated a greater proportion of TBCF to root growth compared to the conifer-dominated hemlock (T. canadensis) stand. Of the three stands, red oak partitioned the greatest proportion of TBCF (similar to 50%) to root growth, and hemlock the least. Low root growth rates in hemlock may be related to the arrival and spread of the invasive pest, hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), during the study period. Ongoing research in the eastern hemlock stand may yet determine how whole tree allocation and partitioning change as a result of this infestation.","[Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Boston Univ, PhD Program Biogeosci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Abramoff, Rose Z.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Finzi, AC (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",afinzi@bu.edu,"Abramoff, Rose Zheng/I-6266-2016","Abramoff, Rose Zheng/0000-0002-3393-3064","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1065029, DEB-0743564]; American Association of University Women (AAUW) American Dissertation Fellowship; Office of Science (BER)United States Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [10-DOE-1053]","The authors thank Colin Averill, John Drake, William Munger, and Patrick Sorensen for use of data.

Specificity of plant response to different AM fungal species is a prerequisite for AM fungal composition to have an effect on plant community dynamics. We test determinants of specificity of plant response to AM fungi across six early-and six late-successional tallgrass prairie plants by growing them with one of seven different AM fungal species and a non-inoculated control. We found that late-successional species were more responsive, and demonstrated greater specificity, toward individual AM fungal taxa than early-successional species. There was no phylogenetic signal for plant responsiveness or specificity of plant response. Phylogenetic multiple regressions indicated that successional stage, plant growth rate, and overall responsiveness were significant predictors of fungal specificity independent of shared phylogeny. These results suggest that plant response to mycorrhizal fungi is evolutionarily labile and coevolves with plant life history. Our results also suggest that AM fungal community dynamics can be particularly important for the establishment and subsequent dynamics of late-successional plants.","[Koziol, Liz] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 35B Takeru Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Koziol, L (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 East 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.; Koziol, L (reprint author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 35B Takeru Higuchi Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",ekoziol@indiana.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1050237, DEB-0919434]; SERDP [RC-2330]; IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant; Nature Conservancy; Bever/Schultz laboratory group","We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1050237 and DEB-0919434), the SERDP (RC-2330), and the IU Graduate Student Sustainability Research Development Grant, the Nature Conservancy, and the Bever/Schultz laboratory group, with special thanks to G.

Vulnerability segmentation hypothesis proposes that plant branches are more resistant to cavitation than their terminal leaves, namely, the difference in vulnerability to cavitation between branches and their terminal leaves is positive (P50leaf-branch>0). This allows leaves to act as safety valves to protect hydraulic pathway from dysfunction. 2. Recent studies showed that several species from humid regions have negative values of P50leaf-branch, indicating a lack of vulnerability segmentation in these species (LVS species). 3. We hypothesize that compared with species from humid regions, vulnerability segmentation is critical and necessary for arid species to survive droughts, but LVS species may take compensatory hydraulic strategies to maintain safety margins during drought periods. 4. We compile branch and leaf hydraulic trait data of 69 broadleaved woody species belonging to different biomes with contrasting climatic conditions as indicated by variable aridity index (AI), and we find that P50leaf-branch becomes small and even negative with the increase of AI. Although leaves of LVS species may lose their function as safety valves, their deep rooting, great hydraulic conductivity, and/or high stem capacitance features are critical for them to maintain hydraulic safety. 5. The results indicate that vulnerability segmentation is evidently common for species from arid regions, but not necessarily the case for some species from humid regions. With robust cavitation-resistant leaves and effective hydraulic compensatory strategies, LVS species can maintain water supply and the functionality of leaves, thus giving them a hydraulic advantage over counterparts in the face of potential drought stress.

The majority of plant species associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. By contrast, the minority associate with ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, have abandoned the symbiosis and are nonmycorrhizal (NM), or engage in an intermediate, weakly AM symbiosis (AMNM). To understand the processes that maintain the mycorrhizal symbiosis or cause its loss, we reconstructed its evolution using a similar to 3,000-species seed plant phylogeny integrated with mycorrhizal state information. Reconstruction indicated that the common ancestor of seed plants most likely associated with AM fungi and that the EM, NM, and AMNM states descended from the AM state. Direct transitions from the AM state to the EM and NM states were infrequent and generally irreversible, implying that natural selection or genetic constraint could promote stasis once a particular state evolved. However, the evolution of the NM state was more frequent via an indirect pathway through the AMNM state, suggesting that weakening of the AM symbiosis is a necessary precursor to mutualism abandonment. Nevertheless, reversions from the AMNM state back to the AM state were an order of magnitude more likely than transitions to the NM state, suggesting that natural selection favors the AM symbiosis over mutualism abandonment.","[Maherali, Hafiz] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Oberle, Brad] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Stevens, Peter F.] Missouri Bot Garden, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cornwell, William K.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [McGlinn, Daniel J.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA","Maherali, H (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",maherali@uoguelph.ca,"Cornwell, William/I-4083-2019",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Guelph; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent National Science Foundation)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [EF-0423641],"This work was supported by a Discovery grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the University of Guelph, and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent; National Science Foundation EF-0423641) through support for the Tempo and Mode of Plant Trait Evolution Working Group and the sabbatical and short-term visitor program.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can alleviate effects of abiotic stress by improving host plant stress tolerance, but the direct effects of abiotic stress on AM fungi are less well understood. We propose two hypotheses predicting how AM fungi will respond to abiotic stress. The stress exclusion hypothesis predicts that AM fungal abundance and diversity will decrease with persistent abiotic stress. The mycorrhizal stress adaptation hypothesis predicts that AM fungi will evolve in response to abiotic stress to maintain their fitness. We conclude that abiotic stress can have effects on AM fungi independent of the effects on the host plant. AM fungal communities will change in composition in response to abiotic stress, which may mean the loss of important individual species. This could alter feedbacks to the plant community and beyond. AM fungi will adapt to abiotic stress independent of their host plant. The adaptation of AM fungi to abiotic stress should allow the maintenance of the plant-AM fungal mutualism in the face of changing climates.","[Millar, Niall S.] Univ Dundee, Sch Life Sci, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland; [Bennett, Alison E.] James Hutton Inst, Ecol Sci, Errol Rd, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Bennett, AE (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Ecol Sci, Errol Rd, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland.",Alison.Bennett@hutton.ac.uk,,,Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate (RESAS) Work package Themes,"The authors would like to thank Alison Karley, Rohan Riley, and Philip Smith for comments on the manuscript, and acknowledge funding support from the Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate (RESAS) Work package Themes one and three.",,181,26,28,3,57,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2016,182,3,,,,,625,641,,10.1007/s00442-016-3673-7,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ2ME,WOS:000385675100001,27350364,"Green Published, Other Gold",,,10/31/19J,"Tanikawa, T; Ikeno, H; Dannoura, M; Yamase, K; Aono, K; Hirano, Y",,,,"Tanikawa, Toko; Ikeno, Hidetoshi; Dannoura, Masako; Yamase, Keitarou; Aono, Kenji; Hirano, Yasuhiro",,,"Leaf litter thickness, but not plant species, can affect root detection by ground penetrating radar",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Coarse roots; Leaf litter; Nondestructive root detection; Phyllostachys pubescens; Root diameter,TREE ROOTS; BIOMASS; CARBON,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR), a nondestructive tool that can detect coarse tree roots, has not yet become a mature technology for use in forests. In this study, we asked two questions concerning this technology: (i) Does the leaf litter layer influence root detection and major indices based on the time interval between zero crossings (T) and the amplitude area (A)? (ii) Can GPR images discriminate roots of different plant species? Roots buried in a sandy bed, which was covered with different thicknesses of leaf litter, were scanned using a 900 MHz GPR antenna. Roots of four plant species in the bed were also scanned. Leaf litter decreased root reflections without distorting the shape of the hyperbolas in the radar profile. A values decreased with increasing litter thickness, whereas T was independent of litter thickness. For all species combined, GPR indices were significantly correlated with root diameter. Leaf litter dramatically decreased root detection, but the influence of the litter could be ignored when the sum of T for all reflection waveforms (I T) pound is adopted to estimate root diameter. To use A values to detect roots, litter should be removed or equalized in thickness. Radar profiles could not reliably differentiate among roots belonging to plants of different species.","[Tanikawa, Toko] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi Ku, 68 Nagai Kyutaro, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Ikeno, Hidetoshi] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, Kobe, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Dannoura, Masako] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yamase, Keitarou] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, Shiso 6712515, Japan; [Aono, Kenji] Gen Environm Technos Co Ltd KANSO Technos, Osaka 5410052, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Tanikawa, T (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kansai Res Ctr, Fushimi Ku, 68 Nagai Kyutaro, Kyoto 6120855, Japan.",tanikawa@affrc.go.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014","Yamase, Keitaro/0000-0002-2689-0633","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [22380090, 25252027]; Program for Supporting Activities for Female Researchers; MEXT's Special Coordination Fund for Promoting Science and Technology","We thank Y.

Most knowledge on tree species response to drought is based on monocultures, even though many of the forests in the world consist of mixed stands. We aimed to investigate how trees respond to summer drought when grown in a three species mixture. For two subsequent summers canopy throughfall, and subsequently soil water potential, was reduced using sub-canopy roofs in monocultures and mixtures of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Fagus sylvatica,. The overyielding of the mixed stand was not affected by the drought using either above or below ground production, standing fine root biomass or soil respiration as parameters. However, Alnus glutinosa was the most negatively affected when growing in monoculture, whereas this species was less affected when growing in mixture. In contrast, Betula pendula was most negatively affected when growing in mixture. Fagus sylvatica was least affected by the drought and maintained growth over the two years. A water demanding species as Alnus glutinosa can perform well in a mixture during drought and not be outcompeted.

AM and ECM plants differ in the soil decomposers they promote and the quality of litter they produce, which may result in different patterns of organic matter decomposition, and hence, soil C loss. To determine how mycorrhizal associations indirectly affect decomposer activity, we collected soils and litters from four AM and four ECM tree species from a mixed-deciduous temperate forest for a field and laboratory study. We first characterized insitu patterns in soil chemistry and soil microbial biomass among these eight tree species. We then conducted a microcosm experiment with mineral soils, leaf litter and fine roots originating from these tree species, where we reciprocally crossed litters and soils, and quantified the rate of heterotrophic respiration over a 140-day laboratory incubation. In natural forest conditions, AM tree soils contained lower total C and microbial biomass C:N relative to ECM tree soils. In our microcosm experiment, AM soils supported greater heterotrophic respiration than did ECM soils. The addition of AM litter stimulated respiration more than did ECM litter, owing to the lower C:N of AM litter. Matching the mycorrhizal identity of litter and soil resulted in a difference in total respiration, such that combinations of AM litters with AM soils lost more C than did combinations of ECM litters with ECM soils.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that AM and ECM trees have differing indirect effects on soil decomposer activity through the decomposers they cultivate and/or the quality of organic matter they produce. Mycorrhizal differences in litter quality accentuate these effects on soil C loss and may explain patterns in soil C dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Taylor, Melanie K.; Wurzburger, Nina] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Taylor, Melanie K.] USDA Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Wurzburger, N (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ninawurz@uga.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",,,,51,17,19,0,140,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Hydrological gradients provide a scenario where strong selection forces have led to species segregation in communities along the hydrological niche axes due to specific adaptations to their ambient environment. However, much less is known about the processes enabling species with wide ecological amplitudes, such as Solanum dulcamara L., to occupy the contrasting niches at the far ends of the gradient. Here, we investigate the question whether local adaptation is indeed the driving mechanism enabling this species to inhabit contrasting wet and dry habitats. Using molecular analyses and performing a common garden experiment, we examined whether genetic and phenotypic differentiation had occurred between populations originating from flooding- and drought-prone habitat pairs from nine different locations. We also tested whether plants were better adapted to their home site stress. We found a significant genetic variation but hardly any phenotypic differentiation between populations from contrasting habitats for plants grown under optimal conditions. Surprisingly, comparison of the genetic differentiation in neutral markers with that in phenotypic traits using the Q(ST)-F-ST (estimated by ?(PT)) approach revealed that the Q(ST) values were consistently and significantly smaller than the ?(PT) values. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that directional selection is an important component enabling S.dulcamara to survive under contrasting habitat conditions. In addition, no home site effects were detected for responses to flooding and drought treatments. All plants were characterized by high levels of plasticity for traits associated with flooding and drought tolerance, such as rapid adventitious root formation upon flooding and increased root to shoot ratio in response to drought, irrespective of habitat of origin. Moreover, no trade-offs in such flooding and drought responses were found.Synthesis. Our results show that S.dulcamara has not evolved locally adapted populations in response to flooding and drought stress, despite genetic differentiation and despite the presumably strong selection gradient. The generally high levels of adaptive plasticity in traits increasing flooding and drought tolerance may be the main mechanism allowing S.dulcamara to occupy hydrologically contrasting habitats.","[Zhang, Qian; Visser, Eric J.

There is increasing evidence that this may be due to competition between primary producers and microbial decomposers for soil nitrogen, mediated by ectomycorrhizal fungi. This competitive interaction inhibits decomposition and increases soil carbon storage. However, other work suggests elevated carbon storage is due to recalcitrant plant tissue chemistry in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems, rather than ectomycorrhizal competition for soil nitrogen. These two frameworks make similar predictions for soil carbon storage, making them difficult to distinguish empirically. Here I argue that the ectomycorrhizal-recalcitrance hypothesis is not well supported by recent developments in the understanding of soil carbon chemistry, or evolutionary relationships among ectomycorrhizal plants. Therefore, differences in input chemistry are not sufficient to discount alternative mechanisms of carbon stabilization in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems. Future work on EM-specific stabilization of soil C should focus on alternative mechanisms including competition for N, direct antagonistic interactions, and other microbial community driven mechanisms.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the rhizosphere microbial community following the occurrence of P. notoginseng root-rot disease using three different techniques: phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional-inference-based approaches (PICRUSt: phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states). With paired comparison design, we studied the rhizosphere microbial community structure of healthy and root-rot P. notoginseng plants in Wenshan region of Yunnan province, southwest China. Microbial PLFA profiles showed that the abundance of total microbes, bacteria, fungi and the proportion of gram-negative bacteria in the rhizosphere soil of diseased plants were significantly higher than those of healthy plants. Furthermore, the proportion of gram positive bacterial, actinomycetal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal PLFA5 were significantly lower in the rhizosphere soil of diseased plants, and Proteobacteria was identified to be the marker phylum in rhizosphere soil of diseased P. notoginseng. By PICRUSt analysis, bacterial community function was predicted based on 16S rRNA sequencing. It was found that the potential function of microbial community from rhizosphere soil of diseased P. notoginseng differed significantly from that of healthy plants. Moreover, soil variables including soil texture and soil organic carbon significantly correlated with PLFA profiles, and were identified as important abiotic factors in shaping microbial communities.

Shannon biodiversity index showed that AMF species diversity varied according to soil physico-chemical characteristics of the different sites. However, seasonal variation affected abundance but not AMF species biodiversity. Significant effect of soil and seasons on AMF root colonization rate was also observed.

However, how these feedbacks depend on the soil environment remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that disintegrating a naturally aggregated soil may influence the outcome of PSF by affecting microbial communities. Furthermore, we expected plants to differentially interact with soil structure and the microbial communities due to varying root morphology. We carried out a feedback experiment with nine plant species (five forbs and four grasses) where the training phase consisted of aggregated versus disintegrated soil. In the feedback phase, a uniform soil was inoculated in a fully factorial design with soil washings from conspecific- versus heterospecific-trained soil that had been either disintegrated or aggregated. This way, the effects of prior soil structure on plant performance in terms of biomass production and allocation were examined. In the training phase, soil structure did not affect plant biomass. But on disintegrated soil, plants with lower specific root length (SRL) allocated more biomass aboveground. PSF in the feedback phase was negative overall. With training on disintegrated soil, conspecific feedback was positively correlated with SRL and significantly differed between grasses and forbs. Plants with higher SRL were likely able to easily explore the disintegrated soil with smaller pores, while plants with lower SRL invested in belowground biomass for soil exploration and seemed to be more susceptible to fungal pathogens. This suggests that plants with low SRL could be more limited by PSF on disintegrated soils of early successional stages. This study is the first to examine the influence of soil structure on PSF. Our results suggest that soil structure determines the outcome of PSF mediated by SRL. We recommend to further explore the effects of soil structure and propose to include root performance when working with PSF.","[Bergmann, Joana; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, DCPS, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Bergmann, Joana; Heinze, Johannes; Joshi, Jasmin; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany; [Verbruggen, Erik] Univ Antwerp, Dept Plant & Vegetat Ecol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Heinze, Johannes; Joshi, Jasmin] Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res, Inst Biochem & Biol, Potsdam, Germany; [Xiang, Dan; Chen, Baodong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Dan] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany.",rillig@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Chen, Baodong/A-7707-2009; Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Chen, Baodong/0000-0002-1790-7800; Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465; Heinze, Johannes/0000-0002-3556-5883; Verbruggen, Erik/0000-0001-7015-1515",DFG Priority ProgramGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [1374]; DFG-Project SOILFEEDBACKGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RI 1815/6-1],"We thank Marty Altmann for his assistance in the greenhouse and him and Alia Tsang for measuring root colonization.

Therefore, wetland vegetation succession between plants with different photosynthetic pathways may ultimately influence the wetland carbon budget. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has the largest floodplain wetland group in China. Tian'e Zhou wetland reserve (29 degrees 48'N, 112 degrees 33'E) is located in Shishou city, Hubei province and covers about 77.5 square kilometers. Hemathria altissima (C4) was found gradually being replaced by Carex argyi (C3) for several years in this place. An in situ experiment was conducted in Tian'e Zhou wetland to determine the change of soil respiration as the succession proceeds. Soil respiration, substrate-induced respiration, and bacterial respiration of the C4 species was greater than those of the C3 species, but below-ground biomass and fungal respiration of the C4 species was less than that of the C3 species. There were no significant differences in above-ground biomass between the two species. Due to the higher photosynthesis capability, higher soil respiration and lower total plant biomass, we inferred that the C4 species, H. altissima, may transport more photosynthate below-ground as a substrate for respiration. The photosynthetic pathway of plants might therefore play an important role in regulating soil respiration. As C. argyi replaces H. altissima, the larger plant biomass and lower soil respiration would indicate that the wetland in this area could fix more carbon in the soil than before.","[Chen, Jingrui; Wang, Qiulin; Li, Ming; Liu, Fan] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jingrui] Jiangxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Soil & Fertilizer & Resources & Environm, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiulin] Jiangxi Acad Sci, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Hubei Key Lab Wetland Evolut & Ecol Restorat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Li, W (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liwei@wbgcas.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0601000]; Innovation Key project of CAS [KSCX2-YW-Z-1023-5]; Young Talent Programme of NSF-Hubei [2007ABB041]; WWF [CN087901],"National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFA0601000; Innovation Key project of CAS, Grant/Award Number: KSCX2-YW-Z-1023-5; Young Talent Programme of NSF-Hubei, Grant/Award Number: 2007ABB041; WWF, Grant/Award Number: CN087901",,64,2,2,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In this study, we investigated how disturbance and biotic interactions with pathogens and microbial symbionts mediate invasion of American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) in early-and late-successional coastal dune habitats. First, we tested the effect of disturbance on biomasses of two exotic beachgrass species (the invading A. breviligulata and the established A. arenaria) and a native beachgrass (Elymus mollis) by growing plants with and without a disturbance manipulation in early-and late-successional habitats. We quantified root colonization by fungal symbionts and infection by plant-parasitic nematodes to determine the effect of potential mutualists and pathogens on plant biomass. Second, we tested whether soil microbes associated with the established A. arenaria mediated A. breviligulata invasion by inoculating potted plants with microbes from early-and late-successional habitat. We found no effect of disturbance on biomass of the invading A. breviligulata or native E. mollis, whereas A. arenaria biomass increased when grown with disturbance. Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and by fungal endophytes were poor predictors of plant biomass, and plant-parasitic nematodes were infrequently observed. Microbe addition increased belowground biomass of A. breviligulata, but not A. arenaria, compared to control treatments. Overall, our results suggest that A. breviligulata invasion in both the early-and late-successional habitat is mediated by its lack of disturbance dependence and positive effects of soil microbes. These results have important implications for other primary successional systems and contribute to our understanding of how ecological contexts influence invasion processes.","[David, Aaron S.; May, Georgiana; Schmidt, Derek; Seabloom, Eric W.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [May, Georgiana] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [David, Aaron S.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA","David, AS (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.; David, AS (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA.",asdavid@bio.miami.edu,,"Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0653827, NSF 00039202, DEB 1045608]; University of MinnesotaUniversity of Minnesota System; Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [EPA/NCER R833836]","We thank S.

A total of 23 AMF species were identified at six sites. Of these, six belonged to the genus Funneliformis (Glomeraceae), five to Rhizophagus (Glomeraceae), three to Glomus (Glomeraceae), two to Acaulospora (Acaulosporaceae), two to Claroideoglomus (Claroideoglomeraceae), two to Septoglomus (Glomeraceae), one to Ambispora (Ambisporaceae), one to Scutellospora (Gigasporaceae) and one to Sclerocystis (Glomeraceae). The species that occurred in the largest proportion of soil samples were Rhizophagus intraradices (75%) and Funneliformis dimorphicum (66.7%). Soil-available potassium was positively correlated with mycorrhizal colonization and species richness. Spore density was negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was positively correlated with total potassium. Most of the soil and climatic factors measured affected the AMF indices directly rather than indirectly. The relative abundances of 13 AMF species were strongly affected by precipitation, temperature, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and available potassium. This suggests that AMF species are diverse and Funneliformis was the most common and dominant AMF genus in the rhizosphere soil under black locust in the Loess Plateau. Precipitation directly affected AMF status and diversity in this distinctive semi-arid ecosystem.","[He, F.; Tang, M.] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, F.; Tang, M.; Yang, R.; Zhang, H.

Environmental 16S rDNA surveys have identified a number of tenericute clades in diverse environments, introducing the possibility that these Tenericutes may represent non-host-associated, free-living microorganisms. Metagenomic sequencing of deep-sea methane seep sediments resulted in the assembly of two genomes from a Tenericutes-affiliated clade currently known as 'NB1-n' (SILVA taxonomy) or 'RF3' (Greengenes taxonomy). Metabolic reconstruction revealed that, like cultured members of the Mollicutes, these 'NB1-n' representatives lack a tricarboxylic acid cycle and instead use anaerobic fermentation of simple sugars for substrate level phosphorylation. Notably, the genomes also contained a number of unique metabolic features including hydrogenases and a simplified electron transport chain containing an RNF complex, cytochrome bd oxidase and complex I. On the basis of the metabolic potential predicted from the annotated genomes, we devised an anaerobic enrichment media that stimulated the growth of these Tenericutes at 10 degrees C, resulting in a mixed culture where these organisms represented similar to 60% of the total cells by targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Visual identification by FISH confirmed these organisms were not directly associated with Eukaryotes and electron cryomicroscopy of cells in the enrichment culture confirmed an ultrastructure consistent with the defining phenotypic property of Tenericutes, with a single membrane and no cell wall. On the basis of their unique gene content, phylogenetic placement and ultrastructure, we propose these organisms represent a novel class within the Tenericutes, and suggest the names Candidatus 'Izimaplasma sp. HR1' and Candidatus 'Izimaplasma sp. HR2' for the two genome representatives.","[Skennerton, Connor T.; Orphan, Victoria J.] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, 1200 East Calif Blvd,MC 100-23, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Haroon, Mohamed F.; Tyson, Gene W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Australian Ctr Ecogen, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Briegel, Ariane; Shi, Jian; Jensen, Grant J.] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Jensen, Grant J.] CALTECH, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Tyson, Gene W.] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Haroon, Mohamed F.] KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Briegel, Ariane] Leiden Univ, Sylvius Lab, Sylviusweg 72, NL-23333 BE Leiden, Netherlands","Skennerton, CT; Orphan, VJ (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, 1200 East Calif Blvd,MC 100-23, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",c.skennerton@gmail.com; vorphan@gps.caltech.edu,"Tyson, Gene W/C-6558-2013; Orphan, Victoria/K-1002-2014","Tyson, Gene W/0000-0001-8559-9427; Skennerton, Connor/0000-0003-1320-4873; Orphan, Victoria/0000-0002-5374-6178","Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF3780]; US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0003940, DE-SC0010574]; Caltech's Center for Environmental Microbial Interactions; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; ARC Queen Elizabeth II fellowshipAustralian Research Council [ARC-DP1093175]","This work is funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF3780 and the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological Environmental Research under award numbers DE-SC0003940 and DE-SC0010574 (to VJO).

Since some exotic plants interact differently with soil biota such as AM fungi in their new range, range-based shifts in AM responsiveness could shift competitive interactions between exotic and resident plants, although this remains poorly studied. We explored whether genotypes of the annual exotic Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle), collected from populations across the native and non-native ranges, differed in responsiveness to AM fungi in the introduced range and whether range-based differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness affected how strongly C. solstitialis tolerated competition with the North American native bunchgrass, Stipa pulchra. Grown alone, C. solstitialis from both ranges derived only weak benefits from AM fungi. However, association with AM fungi was costly to plants when grown in competition with S. pulchra. The magnitude of the suppressive effect of AM fungi was greater for genotypes from native versus introduced populations.Synthesis. Many exotic invasive species are known to associate weakly with AM fungi, which may be beneficial in disturbed habitats where competition for resources is low. Our results indicate that reduced mycorrhizal associations may also benefit invaders in a competitive environment. Centaurea solstitialis were more strongly suppressed by established S. pulchra plants in the presence versus absence of AM fungi, but exotic genotypes were less suppressed than native genotypes. This suggests that AM fungi may contribute to invasion resistance in established native communities, but range-based shifts in the way exotic genotypes respond to AM fungal partners may counter such biotic resistance.","[Waller, Lauren P.; Callaway, Ragan M.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, 32 Campus Dr,HS 104, Missoula, MT USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Ortega, Yvette K.] US Dept Agr Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Missoula, MT 59081 USA","Waller, LP (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 84, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",lauren.waller@lincoln.ac.nz,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0614406]; NSF EPSCoR Track-1 [EPS-1101342],"This work was funded by an NSF grant DEB 0614406 to JLM and RMC.

To test how plant functional groups (FGs: graminoids, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes) and plant traits relate to PSF, we grew 48 grassland species in sterilized soil, sterilized soil with own species soil inoculum and sterilized soil with soil inoculum from all species, and quantified relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and per cent arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization (%AMF). Plant growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to sterilized soil (PSFsterilized) reflects net effects of all (generalist+specialized) soil biota. Growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to soil biota of all plant species (PSFaway) reveals effects of more specialized soil organisms. PSFsterilized showed that graminoids and small herbs have a negative and tall herbs a positive response to their own soil biota, whereas legumes responded neutrally. However, PSFaway showed that on average, all plant FGs benefitted from growing with other species' soil biota, suggesting that pathogens are more specialized than plant growth-promoting soil biota. Feedback to plant growth from all soil biota (PSFsterilized) was stronger than from more specialized soil biota (PSFaway) and could be predicted by SRL and especially by %AMF colonization. Species with high SRL and low %AMF colonization when grown in away soil experienced most negative soil feedback.Synthesis. Plant species from all plant FGs grow better in soil from other species because of less net negative effects of soil biota (in graminoids), or because of more net positive soil biota effects (in tall herbs). Explorative plant species (high SRL, low %AMF colonization) suffer most from negative feedback of all soil biota, whereas more resource conservative species (low SRL, high %AMF colonization) benefit from soil feedback of all soil biota. These findings help to understand replacement of explorative species during succession. Moreover, we suggest a potentially larger role for species with positive feedback than for species with negative feedback to contribute to maintain plant community productivity of diverse communities over time.","[Cortois, Roeland; van der Putten, Wim H.; De Deyn, Gerlinde B.] Nederlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Schroeder-Georgi, Thomas; Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Dept Special Bot & Funct Biodivers, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Schroeder-Georgi, Thomas; Weigelt, Alexandra] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","De Deyn, GB (reprint author), Nederlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.",gerlinde.dedeyn@wur.nl,"De Deyn, Gerlinde/F-7080-2017; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1451]; NWO-ALW VIDI [864.11.003]; NWONetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [832.13.009],"We are grateful to Amalia Castro and Nasir Uddin for practical assistance.

We utilized the longest ongoing snow removal experiment in the world and an additional set of new plots at the same location in northern Sweden to simultaneously measure the effects of long-term (11 winters) and short-term (1 winter) absence of snow cover on boreal forest understorey plants, including the effects on root growth and phenology. Short-term absence of snow reduced vascular plant cover in the understorey by 42%, reduced fine root biomass by 16%, reduced shoot growth by up to 53% and induced tissue damage on two common dwarf shrubs. In the long-term manipulation, more substantial effects on understorey plant cover (92% reduced) and standing fine root biomass (39% reduced) were observed, whereas other response parameters, such as tissue damage, were observed less. Fine root growth was generally reduced, and its initiation delayed by c. 3 (short-term) to 6weeks (long-term manipulation).Synthesis. We show that one extreme winter with a reduced snow cover can already induce ecologically significant alterations. We also show that long-term changes were smaller than suggested by an extrapolation of short-term manipulation results (using a constant proportional decline). In addition, some of those negative responses, such as frost damage and shoot growth, were even absolutely stronger in the short-term compared to the long-term manipulation. This suggests adaptation or survival of only those individuals that are able to cope with these extreme winter conditions, and that the short-term manipulation alone would overpredict long-term impacts. These results highlight both the ecological importance of snow cover in this boreal forest, and the value of combining short- and long-term experiments side by side in climate change research.","[Blume-Werry, Gesche; Milbau, Ann] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Umea, Sweden; [Kreyling, Juergen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Expt Plant Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Laudon, Hjalmar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Milbau, Ann] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Kliniekstr 25, B-1070 Brussels, Belgium","Blume-Werry, G (reprint author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, Umea, Sweden.",gesche.blume-werry@umu.se,"Kreyling, Juergen/G-4697-2018; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013","Kreyling, Juergen/0000-0001-8489-7289; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Milbau, Ann/0000-0003-3555-8883; Blume-Werry, Gesche/0000-0003-0909-670X",Svartberget field station; Abisko scientific research station; EU COST Action 'ClimMani' [ES1308]; Kempe Foundation; Stiftelsen Oscar och Lili Lamms Minne; SITES (VR); ForWater (Formas); FOMA (SLU); SKB,"We thank Anna Sundelin, Arvid Alm, Laurenz Teuber, Mia (Maria-Theresa) Jessen, Peder Blomkvist and Viktor Sjoblom for invaluable help in the field and laboratory and the Svartberget field station and Abisko scientific research station for support.

The climatic variability hypothesis poses that populations at higher latitudes, due to the stronger variation in temperature, there should be more plastic in response to temperature than populations at lower latitudes. Similarly, populations at locations with stronger precipitation fluctuations should be more plastic in response to water availability than populations at locations with less variable precipitation. We sampled seven and nine populations of Solidago canadensis, a North American native that is invasive in China, along a latitudinal (temperature variability) and a longitudinal (precipitation variability) gradient, respectively, in China, and grew them under two temperature treatments and two water-availability treatments, respectively. Among the four traits with significant variation in plasticity among populations in response to temperature, plasticity of leaf length-to-width ratio was significantly positively correlated with latitude and temperature seasonality of the populations. In addition, root/shoot ratio and water-use efficiency showed significant variation in plasticity among populations in response to water availability, and plasticities of these two traits were significantly negatively correlated with longitude and positively correlated with precipitation seasonality. The observed geographic clines in plasticity suggest that phenotypic plasticity of S. canadensis may have evolved rapidly in regions with different climatic conditions, and this may have contributed to the spread of this invasive species.","[Li, Junmin; Du, Leshan] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Evolutionary Ecol & Conserv, Taizhou 318000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Du, Leshan; Guan, Wenbin; Yu, Fei-Hai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Du, Leshan] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Res Ctr Biodivers, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China","Li, JM (reprint author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Evolutionary Ecol & Conserv, Taizhou 318000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",lijm@tzc.edu.cn,"__, ____/L-7390-2019; Yu, Fei-Hai/O-9395-2016","Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270461]; National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1201100]; Qianjiang Talents Project of Zhejiang Province (type D), China [QJD1302021]; DFG SPP1819 Rapid Evolutionary Adaptation [KL 1866/10-1]","We thank Jianqing Ding and Zhengsheng He for their kind help in collecting plants.

However, spring to autumn changes in the AMF communities harboured in the different propagule forms has not been studied, being this the aim of the present study. A terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism approach was used to monitor, in spring and autumn, the AMF community composition present in the three propagule types associated to five shrub species in a semi-arid Mediterranean environment. The AMF community composition in roots was significantly different between spring and autumn; however, no significant differences were detected in soil propagules (spores and ERM). Different trends were identified according to the preferential biomass allocation patterns of AMF phylotypes, suggesting different life strategies: those allocating mainly into IRM (belonging to the Glomeraceae), ERM (Diversisporaceae and Gigasporaceae) or spores (Pacisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae). Differences of AMF taxa in the biomass allocation patterns among propagules are maintained throughout the year. Progress in the knowledge of functional features of AMF communities and their responses to seasonal variations are important for the AMF application in Mediterranean ecosystems.","[Varela-Cervero, Sara; Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro; Barea, Jose M.; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion] CSIC, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, Estn Expt Zaidin, Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Varela-Cervero, S (reprint author), CSIC, Dept Microbiol Suelo & Sistemas Simbiot, Estn Expt Zaidin, Prof Albareda 1, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",sara.varela@eez.csic.es,"Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015; Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/J-9190-2014","Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718; Garcia, Alvaro Lopez/0000-0001-8267-3572","Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion); Spanish government under Plan Nacional de I + D + I; FEDER fundsEuropean Union (EU) [CGL-2009-08825]; Junta de Andalucia, Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y CienciaJunta de Andalucia [CVI-7640]","Sara Varela-Cervero thanks the Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion) for financial support.

In this study we characterised pathways of C-flow through microbial communities associated with AM hyphae and quantified impacts on mineralisation of native SOM. Continuous, steady-state (CO2)-C-13 labelling was applied throughout the growth period (60 d) of Lolium perenne. Exclusion meshes were used to control access of roots and AM hyphae to soil, and plant-derived C was quantified within microbial PLFA and NLFA, and soil CO2 efflux was partitioned into plant- and soil organic matter (SOM) derived components. Pathways of C-flow through hyphosphere and mycorrhizosphere communities were distinct, as was the fate of plant-derived C from AM hyphae accessing soil through 37 and 1 mu m meshes. Mineralisation of native SOM was increased in all treatments, relative to unplanted controls, and this priming effect was largest for AM hyphae accessing soil through the 1 mu m mesh size. We demonstrated that AM hyphae can strongly increase mineralisation of native SOM and identified distinct pathways of C-flow through hyphosphere communities. Our results suggest that, in addition to affecting rates of litter decomposition, AM hyphae may have a significant influence on turnover of native SOM.","[Paterson, Eric; Sim, Allan] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Davidson, Jane; Daniell, Timothy J.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland","Paterson, E (reprint author), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",eric.paterson@hutton.ac.uk,"Daniell, Tim/E-8482-2011; Paterson, Eric/A-7756-2008","Daniell, Tim/0000-0003-0435-4343; Paterson, Eric/0000-0003-1512-7787",Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services (RESAS) division of the Scottish Government,"We are grateful to Nia Gray for PLFA and NLFA extractions, to Barry Thornton and Maureen Procee for their expertise in <SUP>13</SUP>C compound-specific analyses and to Shona Osborne for support in maintenance of the experiments.

This model assumes that bacteria consume labile substrates twice as fast as fungi, and that mycorrhizal fungi do not decompose organic matter. Here, we build on emerging evidence that points to significant consumption of labile C by fungi, and to the ability of ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose organic matter, to show that labile C constitutes a major and presently underrated source of C for the soil food web. We use a simple model describing the dynamics of a recalcitrant and a labile C pool and their consumption by fungi and bacteria to show that fungal and bacterial populations can coexist in a stable state with large inputs into the labile C pool and a high fungal use of labile C. We propose a new conceptual model for the bottom trophic level of the soil food web, with organic C consisting of a continuous pool rather than two or three distinct pools, and saprotrophic fungi using substantial amounts of labile C. Incorporation of these concepts will increase our understanding of soil food web dynamics and functioning under changing conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Resources enter the soil food web either from roots or from detrital inputs. Compared to this traditional view we are now much more aware of the flow of carbon, nitrogen and other resources through the microbes in the soil food web. Currently, the function of some groups of bacteria and fungi is known. The lowering of the costs of high throughput sequencing methods enables us to acquire more data on who is around, when and where in the soil food web. For soil fauna, gut content analyses in combination with sequencing can reveal feeding preferences, which enables establishing real trophic links based on observations, which can then be visualised as networks of feeding interactions. The fate of carbon flow through the soil food web can be traced by using stable isotopes combined with sequence based techniques. This provides insight into trophic connections and interaction strength. As the sequencing costs decrease rapidly, the level of detail in soil food web knowledge will similarly increase rapidly and enhance the feasibility of combined techniques. Using these techniques to broaden our insight into soil subsystems and their soil food webs will lead to more targeted decisions on management practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies tracking the fate of root derived carbon via stable isotope probing (SIP), however, indicate an important role for saprotrophic fungi as consumers of root exudates. In addition, it was shown that a diverse group of rhizosphere bacteria have the ability to withdraw carbon from saprotrophic fungal hyphae. Based on the fast carbon-flow into saprotrophic rhizosphere fungi and the wide-spread occurrence of rhizosphere bacteria with mycophagous abilities, we argue that the current concept of rhizosphere carbon flow should be revised to account for more complex microbial food web interactions. We propose to split the bacteria thriving in the rhizosphere niche into ""plant-feeders"" and ""fungus-feeders"". The latter would include rhizosphere bacteria feeding on all functional groups of fungi, i.e. including mycorrhiza. To indicate the importance of saprotrophic fungi as a food source for rhizosphere bacteria, we introduce a new niche, the ""sapro-rhizosphere niche"". We want to stimulate a discussion on rhizosphere carbon flow by challenging the established division into a mere bacterial- and fungal channel consisting, of primary consumers, and to point at research directions based on the sapro-rhizosphere concept.

Earthworks that modify natural landforms for the formation of runoff harvesting systems are prevalent in the Israeli drylands, with the aim of establishing afforestation projects. However, serious concerns alarm that such earthworks have detrimental effects on the geo-ecosystem functioning. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the impact of the establishment of contour bench terrace (also called shichs/shychs/shikim) runoff harvesting systems on selected soil properties, with,particular focus on still aggregation. Thus, we assessed the effect of the establishment of contour bench terraces in a multi-aged forestry land, comprised of 2-year-old and 9-year-old afforestation areas, and compared them to 'natural' hillslopes as a reference treatment. The study was implemented in the Ambassadors' Forest, located in the semi-arid northern Negev of Israel, where we sampled the surface soil (at a depth of 0-5 cm) in north- and south-facing hillslopes. Considerable differences were recorded for the afforestation systems between the source (inter-terrace area) and sink (terrace-bottoms) areas. Data normalizing according to the relative cover percentage of the terraces and inter-terrace areas showed that the mean values of mean weight diameter (MWD), stable aggregate content, and particulate organic carbon in the natural hillslopes were 1.4%, 32.4%, and 20%, respectively, greater than in the 9-year-old afforestation systems, and 12.1%, 28.9%, and 31%, respectively, greater than in the 2-year-old systems. Means of clod content, aggregate slaking index, and clay dispersion index in the natural hillslopes were 623%, similar to twofold, and 35.0%, respectively, smaller than in the 9-year-old systems, and almost threefold, nearly twofold, and 46.2%, respectively, smaller than in the 2-year-old areas. The soil calcium carbonate content was similar in soils of the natural hillslopes and 9-year-old afforestation lands, which was similar to 17% smaller than in the 2-year-old afforestation systems. Considerable differences among the land-uses were also recorded for the soil texture. Mean coarse root biomass, despite revealing only a marginally-significant effect (p-value = 0.0765), was 40.0% greater in the natural hillslopes than in the 9-year-old systems, and more than twofold greater than in the 2-year-old systems. Hillslope aspect affected some of the measured properties, revealing only slightly better soil conditions in the (mesic) north- than in the (xeric) south-aspects. The data revealed that forestry-related earthworks degrade the soil quality and geo-ecosystem functioning in the short term. Yet, despite some discrepancies, the data also showed the occurrence of self-restoration processes of the geo-ecosystem over the long term. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and temperature programmed reduction and desorption of acetone. Experimental data revealed that the acetone conversion pathway on the Co, Co-Ni, or Ni catalysts was strongly dependent on the nature of the metal, reaction temperature, and the oxidation state of the metal atoms in nanoparticles surface atoms. Reaction data indicated that the acetone decomposition on reduced metal catalysts at high temperatures (>350 degrees C) occurred mainly via the H-C and C-CO bonds cleavage, leading to the formation of CO, H-2, and C on the metal surface. At low temperatures (200 degrees C) and in the presence of H-2 in the reactor feed, the Ni catalyst catalyzed the hydrogenation of the CO and CHx species formed from acetone activation on the metallic sites, producing CH4. For Co-containing catalysts, at low temperatures (200-350 degrees C) the metal nanoparticles surface was in a higher oxidation degree and promoted the oxidation of acetone. At high temperatures (>350 degrees C), the hydrogenation of CHx and CO species to CH4 was determined by the nanoparticle oxidation degree, which decreased in the order Ni > Co-Ni > Co. With increased temperature, the CHx species decomposed to C and H-2, instead of being hydrogenated to CH4. The oxidation of C by H2O was favored on Co-containing catalysts. The reaction pathways are discussed based on theoretical data obtained from the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the interaction between climate warming and precipitation reduction on soil respiration has not been well documented. This study aimed to determine the impacts of soil warming and throughfall reduction on soil respiration and its components (heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration). A field manipulation experiment with soil warming and throughfall reduction was conducted in an oak natural forest (Quercus aliena) at a transitional climatic zone in central China during the growing seasons (May-November) in 2011 and 2012. Soil temperature was elevated by 1.23-1.66 degrees C relative to the ambient environment by using infrared heaters, and throughfall was reduced by 50% through roof interception. There were significant interactive effects of soil warming and throughfall reduction on soil respiration and autotrophic respiration in both 2011 and 2012. Soil warming substantially elevated soil respiration by 32.0-46.3% and autotrophic respiration by 57.8-63.2% without throughfall reduction, respectively, but suppressed both of them with throughfall reduction. Throughfall reduction increased soil respiration by 16.2-37.2% and autotrophic respiration by 62.9-97.7% under ambient temperature, whereas decreased them by 13.7-29.2% and 22.6-51.9% under soil warming. Heterotrophic respiration was significantly increased by soil warming while showed little effect by throughfall reduction or its interactions with soil warming. The offset of the positive warming effect on soil respiration under throughfall reduction may be attributed mainly to the changes in soil microbial biomass and fine root biomass induced by throughfall reduction. Our observations suggest that either climate warming or precipitation reduction may increase soil CO2 emission, but this stimulation in oak forests will be largely counteracted if climate warming accompanies with simultaneous precipitation reduction at the climatic transitional zone.

However, the detailed processes and mechanisms are unclear. The present study focused on cellular distribution and speciation of Cr in both extraradical mycelium (ERM) and mycorrhizal roots exposed to Cr(VI) by using field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (FE-SEM-EDS), scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy (STXM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy techniques. We found that amounts of particles (possibly extracellular polymeric substances, EPS) were produced on the AM fungal surface upon Cr(VI) stress, which contributed greatly to Cr(VI) reduction and immobilization. With EDS of the surface of AM fungi exposed to various Cr(VI) levels, a positive correlation between Cr and P was revealed, suggesting that phosphate groups might act as counter ions of Cr(III), which was also confirmed by the XAFS analysis. Besides, STXM and XAFS analyses showed that Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) in AM fungal structures (arbuscules, intraradical mycelium, etc.) and cell walls in mycorrhizal roots, and complexed possibly with carboxyl groups or histidine analogues. The present work provided evidence of Cr immobilization on fungal surface and in fungal structures in mycorrhizal roots at a cellular level, and thus unraveled the underlying mechanisms by which AM symbiosis immobilize Cr.

Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 +/- 1.2% of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23% of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0-20 cm). The difference in delta C-13 between the soil, soil water (at 0-20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.","[Zhou, Wen-Jun; Lu, Hua-Zheng; Zhang, Yi-Ping; Sha, Li-Qing; Schaefer, Douglas Allen; Song, Qing-Hai; Deng, Yun; Deng, Xiao-Bao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wen-Jun; Lu, Hua-Zheng; Zhang, Yi-Ping; Sha, Li-Qing; Schaefer, Douglas Allen; Song, Qing-Hai; Deng, Yun; Deng, Xiao-Bao] Chinese Ecosyst Res Net, Xishuangbanna Stn Trop Rain Forest Ecosyst Studie, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wen-Jun; Lu, Hua-Zheng; Song, Qing-Hai] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Zhang, YP; Sha, LQ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Zhang, YP; Sha, LQ (reprint author), Chinese Ecosyst Res Net, Xishuangbanna Stn Trop Rain Forest Ecosyst Studie, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",yipingzh@xtbg.ac.cn; shalq@xtbg.ac.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2016FB073, 2015FB188]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41271056, U1202234, 40801035]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05020302, XDA05050601]; CAS 135 Project [XTBG-F01]; Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFJ-EW-STS-084]","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province (2016FB073, 2015FB188), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271056, U1202234, 40801035), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (nos.

Here we report a novel effect of rhizobia on forage quality in alfalfa. We found that nodulated alfalfa showed an increase in lignin content and a decrease in digestibility in comparison with non-nodulated plants. Detailed studies revealed that nodulation resulted in an increase in monolignol G unit and S unit. An overall increase in lignin content in nodulated alfalfa was associated with more lignified tissues in the stem and an upregulation of transcript levels of several lignin biosynthesis genes. We hypothesize that an increase in lignin content in nodulated alfalfa is a result of defensive response in plants to rhizobial invasion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On this way, we investigated morphological responses of Cedrela fissilis Vell. (Meliaceae) seedlings subjected to different lengths and intensities of flooding. Seedlings of Cedrela fissilis were subjected to two flooding intensity treatments (up to the neck level and total submersion) in three different lengths (five, 15 and 20 days) and we assessed shoot height, numbers of leaf and leaflet, stem diameter and chlorophyll indices a, b and total after 30, 60 and 90 days of recovery from the flood condition. After 90 days of recovery, total height, root diameter, root size, total biomass, leaf area and root growth were evaluated. Non- flooded seedlings constituted a control group. The seedlings subjected to total flooding did not survive. On the other hand, those seedlings under partial flooding restarted growing throughout 90 days of flood recovery. We did not found differences in growth variables and biomass allocation in relation to the control group. However, we observed that plants subjected to 20 days of partial flooding had higher leaf abscission and were accompanied by an increase in the chlorophyll levels. The results indicated that this species shows tolerance to partial flooding and should be carefully selected for planting areas.","[Binotto, Beatris] Lago Azul Consultoria Ambiental, Rua 01,371, BR-89760000 Ita, SC, Brazil; [Antoniazzi, Ana Paula] Florestal Alto Uruguai Ltd, Rua Gentil Miorando 332, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Neumann, Graciele Marta] Programa Posgrad Ecol URI Erechim, Ave Sete Setembro 1621, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Sausen, Tanise Luisa] Univ Reg Integrada, Dept Ciencias Biol, Ave Sete Setembro 1621, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil; [Budke, Jean Carlos] Univ Reg Integrada, Dept Ciencias Biol, Lab Sistemat & Ecol Vegetal ECOSSIS, Ave Sete Setembro 1621, BR-99700000 Erechim, RS, Brazil",,bia_binotto@hotail.com; Ana_antoni@hotmail.com; g_neumann@yahoo.com.br; tasausen@uricer.edu.br,"Sausen, Tanise Luisa/AAB-7706-2019","Sausen, Tanise Luisa/0000-0001-9374-7485",,,,35,1,1,0,6,"CENTRO PESQUISAS FLORESTAIS, UFSM",SANTA MARIA,"DEPT CIENCIAS FLORESTAIS, CAMPUS UNIV, CAIXA POSTAL 5096, SANTA MARIA, RS 00000, BRAZIL",0103-9954,1980-5098,,CIENC FLOREST,Cienc.

Using a branch-order classification, we separated the fine root systems of Larix gmelinii into two classes: first-and second-order roots combined into one (lower-order); third-and fourth-order roots combined into another (higher-order). In a field experiment, we conducted a litterbag study to investigate fine root decomposition and its relationship with root order class and soil depth over 17 months. Despite their lower C:N ratio and smaller diameter, lower-order roots decomposed more slowly compared with higher-order roots over this period. This pattern also seems to hold true at each different depths (10, 20 and 30 cm) in the soil profile. Our data suggest that the slow decomposition rate of lower-order roots may result from their poor carbon quality. Moreover, we found that the decomposition rates of both lower-order and higher-order roots decreased linearly from 10 cm to 30 cm, which implied that a substantially larger fraction of fine root mass would be stabilized as soil organic carbon in the deeper rather than the upper soil layers.","[Sun, Tao; Wang, Qingkui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Dong, Lili; Zhang, Lili; Wu, Zhijie; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Zhengwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongguang] Northeast Forestry Univ, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Sun, T (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",sunt@iae.ac.cn; donglili329@iae.ac.cn; llzhang@iae.ac.cn; wuzj@iae.ac.cn; qwang@iae.ac.cn; liyy@iae.ac.cn; zhanghg@nefu.edu.cn; wangzw@iae.ac.cn,"Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011",,"State Key Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China [2016YFD0300904, 2016YFA0600800]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010400]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31500361]","This work was supported by the State Key Program of China (2016YFD0300904 and 2016YFA0600800), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB15010400), and Natural Science Foundation of China (31500361).",,46,6,9,4,40,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2016,7,10,,,,,,,234,10.3390/f7100234,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,ED2JQ,WOS:000388670800025,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Selzer, LJ; Busso, CA",,,,"Selzer, Luciano J.; Busso, Carlos A.",,,Different canopy openings affect underground traits in herbaceous plants of a southern forest in Patagonia,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,root length density; mycorrhizal colonization; light shade; understory; Tierra del Fuego,ALTERNATIVE SILVICULTURAL PRACTICES; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NOTHOFAGUS-PUMILIO FORESTS; VARIABLE RETENTION; POA-PRATENSIS; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; AGROPYRON-DESERTORUM; ROOT PROLIFERATION; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; GROWTH-RESPONSES,"Forest canopy openings modify the natural environment, producing changes in light quality and intensity, precipitation and temperature. In turn, these changes promote the acclimation of understory species. However, little work has been done on underground responses to those environmental changes. The objective of this work was to determine how Osmorhiza depauperata, Phleum alpinum and Poa pratensis change its root length density and root colonization by mycorrhiza as a function of light availability in a Nothofagus pumilio (i.e. lenga) forest harvested following the variable retention prescription. We selected three microenvironments in an old growth forest harvested by the variable retention prescription: aggregated retention, dispersed retention with influence of aggregated retention and dispersed retention. A non-harvested primary forest (PF), similar to the harvested one, was used as a control. Every 2 months, from October 2008 to April 2009, we took soil cores from randomly selected plants. From these soil cores, root length density and colonization percentage (CP) by arbuscular mycorrhizae were estimated. Light availability changed significantly among the microenvironments. In general, root length density was significantly greater in P. pratensis than in P. alpinum and both species greater than in O. depauperata. Light availability increased root length density in all species, although the magnitude of these increases difference among species. Root length density was 187% greater in P. pratensis, 101% in P. alpinum and 94% in O. depauperata in the disperse retention system than in the PF. Mycorrhiza CP was higher in O. depauperata than in P. alpinum and P. pratensis. Also, it was lower in the PF than in the harvested microenvironments. CPs were very low.","[Selzer, Luciano J.] CADIC CONICET, Houssay 200, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina; [Selzer, Luciano J.] Univ Nacl Tierra del Fuego, Inst Ciencias Polares Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Alem 1036, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina; [Busso, Carlos A.] CERZOS CONICET, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Busso, Carlos A.] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Selzer, LJ (reprint author), CADIC CONICET, Houssay 200, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina.; Selzer, LJ (reprint author), Univ Nacl Tierra del Fuego, Inst Ciencias Polares Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Alem 1036, RA-9410 Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina.",lselzer@untdf.edu.ar,,,Agenda Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PAV2004-22428]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),Agenda Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PAV2004-22428).

Four plots within the stand were selected; tree density was reduced by 50% of the basal area in two plots (thinning treatment), and the other two plots served as controls. The study focused on the main factors that affect soil respiration (R-S) and microbial respiration on the forest floor (R-FFM) and in soil (R-SM): soil temperature (T-S), soil moisture (M-S), soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), soil pH, ground cover biomass (GC), forest floor mass (FF), forest floor carbon (FFC) and nitrogen (FFN), and fine root biomass (FRB). Every 2 months, soil respiration was measured using the soda-lime method, and microbial respiration was measured with the incubation method separately for the soil and forest floor. Results were evaluated yearly and over the 2-year research period. During the first year after treatment, RS was significantly higher (11%) in the thinned plots (1.76 g C m(-2) d(-1)) than in the controls (1.59 g C m(-2) d(-1)). However, there were no significant differences in either the second year or the 2-year study period. In the thinned plots during the research period, R-S was linearly correlated with GC, T-s and FRB. Thinning treatments did not affect R-SM, but interestingly, they did affect R-FFM, which was greater in the control plots than in the thinned plots. R-SM had a significant and positive correlation with soil N and soil pH, while R-FFM was linearly correlated with FFC and C/N ratio of the forest floor in both thinned and control plots during the research period.","[Akburak, Serdar; Makineci, Ender] Istanbul Univ, Fac Forestry, Soil Sci & Ecol Dept, TR-34473 Istanbul, Turkey","Makineci, E (reprint author), Istanbul Univ, Fac Forestry, Soil Sci & Ecol Dept, TR-34473 Istanbul, Turkey.",emak@istanbul.edu.tr,"AKBURAK, SERDAR/D-3776-2019","AKBURAK, SERDAR/0000-0002-9066-1595","Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Istanbul UniversityIstanbul University [9652, UDP-51525]","This paper reports part of the results from the PhD thesis of Serdar Akburak under the supervision of Ender Makineci completed in 2013 at the Science Institute, Istanbul University, Turkey.

This may predictably depend on whether herbivory occurs above or below ground and on relative plant competitive ability. We simulated the potential impact of above-or belowground damage by biocontrol agents on the growth of a woody invader (Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera) through artificial herbivory, with or without competition with a native grass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). We measured two defense responses of Triadica through quantifying constitutive and induced extrafloral nectar production and tolerance of above-and belowground damage (root and shoot biomass regrowth). We examined genetic variation in plant growth and defense across native (China) and invasive (United States) Triadica populations. Without competition, aboveground damage had a greater impact than belowground damage on Triadica performance, whereas with competition and above-and belowground damage impacted Triadica similarly. Whole plant tolerance to damage below ground was negatively associated with tolerance to grass competitors indicating tradeoffs in the ability to tolerate herbivory vs. compete. Competition reduced investment in defensive extrafloral nectar (EFN) production. Aboveground damage inhibited rather than induced EFN production while belowground plant damage did not impact aboveground nectar production. We found some support for the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis for invasive plants as United States plants were larger than native China plants and were more plastic in their response to biotic stressors than China plants (they altered their root to shoot ratios dependent on herbivory and competition treatments). Our results indicate that habitat type and the presence of competitors may be a larger determinant of herbivory impact than feeding mode and suggest that integrated pest management strategies including competitive dynamics of recipient communities should be incorporated into biological control agent evaluation at earlier stages.","[Carrillo, Juli] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Carrillo, J (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",carrillj@purdue.edu,,,NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology; US-NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0820560],We thank Ian Kaplan for helpful comments and discussion.

The sites differ significantly in terms of bio-available heavy metal contents, particularly Zn (34 times more than grasslands), soil texture, CaCO3, organic matter (LOI%), Mg and nitrate content. Principal Component Analysis showed the strong negative correlations between frequency of mycorrhization (F), arbuscular abundance (A%) and intensity of root cortex colonisation (M%) and concentration of bio-available Zn and Cd. Moreover, no positive correlation between root colonization of Molinia and its abundance was found. The frequency of mycorrhization of root fragments (F%) was only slightly different between these two habitats, whereas the intensity of root cortex colonisation (M%) and relative arbuscular abundance (A%) were significantly lower (3 and 4 times respectively) on the post-industrial sites. The bioavailable Zn content in the substratum of post-industrial sites was strongly negatively correlated with species richness, Shannon diversity index and Evenness. In contrast, these relationships were not statistically significant in grasslands. Based on obtained results we could draw a model of possible relationships between root colonization of Molinia, HM content and Molinia abundance on grasslands and post-industrial sites. Bioavailable Zn content in the soil is a one of main factors influencing the Molinia community diversity. In the grasslands, lower amounts of bioavailable Zn, resulted in higher species richness (R) and species diversity (H) which in turn lead to higher root colonization. On the other hand, on the post-industrial sites, the elevated bioavailable Zn content strongly decreases the plant species richness (R) and species diversity (H) and this caused the decline in root colonization parameters. The low species richness on Zn-polluted sites allowed Molinia to reach higher abundance since the competition with other species is reduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Indices of growth used were root, shoot and total mass and shoot dimensions. Water content, xylem water potential during drying and nodule production were also measured. The index of competition used was the intensity of competition coefficient (ICC), which is suitable for additive designs. The Australian species usually grew larger than the Spanish species, in their presence or absence, although the results were sensitive to the index of growth or resource capture used. The Australian legumes usually possessed greater total water content than the co-occurring Spanish legumes. At least five Australian species were less reduced or not affected at all by inter-regional competition compared with growth in isolation. Two Australian legumes performed relatively poorly in the presence of at least four Spanish legumes. The ICC identified many instances of growth promotion (facilitation) of the Australian species, which we attribute to extra nitrogen obtained through enhanced nodulation of both cohabiting species. Five of the seven Spanish species were outcompeted by the Australian species, whereas the growth of two was sometimes facilitated. Although the Spanish legumes had greater competitive ability in the more fertile Australian soils, they remained competitively inferior to the Australian legumes in their first season of growth and none is likely to displace the native legumes at this stage of growth. Longer-term field studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential invasiveness of perennial legumes.","[Perez-Fernandez, Maria A.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ecol Area, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain; [Perez-Fernandez, Maria A.; Lamont, Byron B.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Perez-Fernandez, MA (reprint author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ecol Area, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.; Perez-Fernandez, MA (reprint author), Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",maperfer@upo.es,"Perez-Fernandez, Maria A./E-2583-2013","Perez-Fernandez, Maria A./0000-0001-8234-1893; Lamont, Byron/0000-0001-9279-7149", [REN2001-0749/GLO],"This work was supported by project REN2001-0749/GLO ""Elaboracion de modelos predictivos para el uso de especies pioneras en proyectos de recuperacion de suelos degradados.

However, the knowledge about the effects of simultaneous warming and drought on boreal trees, and especially on their belowground compartments, is still scarce. We studied the responses of four silver birch genotypes to experimental warming at normal and low watering levels after two growing seasons. Variables analysed include mycorrhizal short root growth, fungal biomass (ergosterol) in roots and extramatrical mycelium, and root morphology (root tissue density, root length density, specific root length, specific root surface area). In addition, root and shoot mass fractions were determined. Gt26 had more root mass and also more 2-5 mm diameter roots, but less short roots and ergosterol in its roots than the other genotypes. There were no treatment effects on extramatrical mycelium and mycorrhizal infection levels, but root ergosterol concentrations increased in gt12 due to warming. Drought increased root mass at the expense of shoot growth in gt12, but warming did not cause allometric growth changes in any of the genotypes. Our results show some genotype-dependent responses to warming and drought but also significant within population differences in belowground allocation patterns among the silver birch genotypes.","[Kasurinen, Anne; Koikkalainen, Katariina; Oksanen, Elina; Holopainen, Toini] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Kuopio Campus,POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland; [Anttonen, Mikko J.; Possen, Boy; Rousi, Matti; Vapaavuori, Elina] Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 18, FI-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Kasurinen, A (reprint author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Kuopio Campus,POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",Anne.Kasurinen@uef.fi; Katariina.Koikkalainen@ramboll.fi; manttone@gmail.com; boy.possen@rhdhv.com; Elina.Oksanen@uef.fi; Matti.Rousi@luke.fi; elina.vapaavuori@gmail.com; Toini.Holopainen@uef.fi,,,"University of Eastern Finland; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [133084, 266532]","This work was financially supported by University of Eastern Finland (spearhead project ""Changing climate and biological interactions related to forests"") and Academy of Finland (projects 133084 and 266532).",,44,5,5,4,74,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,OCT,2016,407,2-Jan,,,,,341,353,,10.1007/s11104-016-2891-4,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,DY6GT,WOS:000385205100025,,,,,10/31/19J,"Xiang, WH; Zhou, J; Ouyang, S; Zhang, SL; Lei, PF; Li, JX; Deng, XW; Fang, X; Forrester, DI",,,,"Xiang, Wenhua; Zhou, Jing; Ouyang, Shuai; Zhang, Shengli; Lei, Pifeng; Li, Jiaxiang; Deng, Xiangwen; Fang, Xi; Forrester, David I.",,,Species-specific and general allometric equations for estimating tree biomass components of subtropical forests in southern China,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carbon stock; Coarse root biomass; Coniferous species; Deciduous broadleaved species; Evergreen broadleaved species; Seemingly unrelated regression,LEAF-AREA INDEX; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; CARBON STOCKS; TROPICAL FORESTS; NATURAL FORESTS; ROOT BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEMS; MODEL; SEQUESTRATION; ALLOCATION,"Chinese subtropical forests contain a diversity of tree species and exhibit a high carbon (C) sequestration capacity, but biomass and C stock assessments in subtropical secondary forests remain uncertain because of a limited availability of allometric equations and an uncertain applicability of existing allometric equations that have not been tested for these forests. We developed allometric equations for important coniferous (Pinus massoniana), deciduous broadleaved (Alniphyllum fortunei, Choerospondias axillaris, Liquidambar formosana) and evergreen broadleaved (Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Litsea rotundifolia, Schima superba) species. A total of 70 trees (10 trees for each species) with diameters at breast height (D) ranging from 2.6 to 50.9 cm were destructively harvested and dissected into tree components (stem, branch, leaf and coarse root). Species-specific equations using D alone as the predictor variable fitted the data well (p < 0.0053 and R (2) > 0.72) for each tree component. Including height (H) in the form of D (2) H only improved the regression fit for A. fortunei and L. rotundifolia. The relationships of branch, leaf and root biomass against D varied among tree species. General equations for functional groups and all species combined showed comparable bias for stem, aboveground and total tree biomass to species-specific equations. We recommend the general equations of multiple species to estimate forest biomass at regional scales and also to estimate stem, aboveground and total tree biomass for each species when species-specific allometric equations are not available at a given site. For branch, leaf and root biomass, species-specific equations are preferred, even though this requires biomass data for additional tree species.","[Xiang, Wenhua; Zhou, Jing; Ouyang, Shuai; Zhang, Shengli; Lei, Pifeng; Deng, Xiangwen; Fang, Xi] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, 498 Southern Shaoshan Rd, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Lei, Pifeng; Deng, Xiangwen; Fang, Xi] Huitong Natl Stn Sci Observat & Res Chinese Fir P, Huitong 438107, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiaxiang] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Forestry, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Forrester, David I.] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Silviculture, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Xiang, WH (reprint author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, 498 Southern Shaoshan Rd, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Xiang, WH (reprint author), Huitong Natl Stn Sci Observat & Res Chinese Fir P, Huitong 438107, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiangwh2005@163.com,"Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013","deng, xiang wen/0000-0002-9399-1231","Programme of State Forestry Special Fund for Public Welfare Sectors of China [201304317]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31570447, 31170426]; Robert Bosch foundation [32.5.8003.0114.0]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FO 791/4-1]","This study was supported by the Programme of State Forestry Special Fund for Public Welfare Sectors of China (201304317) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570447 and 31170426).

We utilised the Illumina MiSeq platform to sequence the ITS and LSU gene regions, with the SSU region used to target arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The two plant species largely share a fungal community, which is dominated by widespread generalists. Fungi detected on only one species were rare, accounting for a small proportion of the data. The SSU region recovered AMF from more samples and from more Glomeromycota lineages than ITS or LSU.

Drought stress can trigger tree mortality but the impact depends on stress intensity (water demand and availability) and on the vulnerability of the individual. Therefore, most research focusses on the species-specific properties such as water use efficiency or hydraulic conductivity that determine vulnerability. At the ecosystem scale, however, tree properties that have been found important for drought sensitivity or resistance vary with individual size and resource availability within a forest-also within the same species. This is caused by different environmental conditions for each tree and hence different growth histories of individuals generating specific anatomical and physiological features. Individual drought stress sensitivity might thus be considerably different from stand scale sensitivity. Indeed, empirical evidence shows that drought stress impact depends on tree social position which can be defined in degrees of suppression but correlated to resource availability, stress sensitivity and stress exposure. In this review, we collect such evidence and discuss the role of microclimate and soil water distribution as well as anatomical and physiological adjustments, which might serve as foundation for better-adapted management strategies to mitigate drought stress impacts. Finally, we define model requirements aiming to capture stand-scale drought responses or management impacts related to drought stress mitigation.","[Grote, Ruediger] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Gessler, Arthur; Hommel, Robert] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Hommel, Robert] Hsch Nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde, Schicklerstr 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Poschenrieder, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Yield Sci, Hans Carl v Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Priesack, Eckart] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany","Grote, R (reprint author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",Ruediger.Grote@kit.edu,"Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Grote, Rudiger/A-7350-2013","Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Grote, Rudiger/0000-0001-6893-6890","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [GE 1090/8-1, GE 1090/9-1]",We acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under contract numbers GE 1090/8-1 and 9-1.,,170,13,16,11,87,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Root volume reduction is a common occurrence in silvicultural, urban, and scientific environments, often the direct result of trenching applications. Although this interference is widespread near forest roads and in rural and urban areas, trees' growth reactions to these limitations have rarely been analysed. Here, we compare the growth of 81 mature Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) trees, trenched for an experiment down to 1 m depth in a Luvisol soil (Parabraunerde) in 2010, and compared with 69 untrenched trees. The trenching was conducted prior to a long-term precipitation-exclusion treatment in a temperate mixed forest in Southern Germany. Stem and crown sizes, tree positions, distance to the trench, and annual stem growth of the 150 trees were measured from 2006 through 2013. Statistical analysis revealed that (1) stem growth reduction does not correlate with the loss of rooting area by trenching, (2) trenching does not significantly decrease the stem growth in the long-term post-trenching application, and (3) European beech showed a greater reaction in the first years after trenching as indicated by a greater decrease in stem growth. The relationship between stem growth reduction and the loss of rooting area arises during the first year post-trenching, but diminishes by the third year. The trenching effect on stem growth was strongest in trees at the plot edge and diminished towards the centre of the plots, where the actual study trees of the precipitation-exclusion experiment were located. The relevance of trenching for growth reduction is discussed, including potential underlying mechanisms and conclusions about experimental interferences.","[Pretzsch, H.; Schuetze, G.; Roetzer, T.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Bavaria, Germany; [Bauerle, T.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Haeberle, K.

We propose that distinct aspects of environmental change associated with N enrichment (resource limitation, asymmetric competition, and interactions with soil microbes) drive different aspects of plant response. We test this in greenhouse mesocosms, experimentally manipulating each factor across three ecosystems: tallgrass prairie, alpine tundra and desert grassland. We found that resource limitation controlled productivity responses to N enrichment in all systems. Asymmetric competition was responsible for diversity declines in two systems. Plant community composition was impacted by both asymmetric competition and altered soil microbes, with some contributions from resource limitation. Results suggest there may be generality in the mechanisms of plant community change with N enrichment. Understanding these links can help us better predict N response across a wide range of ecosystems.","[Farrer, Emily C.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Farrer, Emily C.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA","Farrer, EC (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.; Farrer, EC (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.",efarrer@tulane.edu,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919569]; Niwot Ridge LTER [DEB-0423662, DEB-1027341]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Sevilleta LTERs","We thank Lisa August-Schmidt, Katherine Bailey, Nicolas Cabrera, Truc Dinh, Amy Foo, Shiyang Fu, Tammy Lee, Donna Lek, Liana Nichols, Nicole Parish, Alexandra Race, Louis Spanias, and the Suding lab for their assistance in planting, harvesting and processing samples.

This study was conducted on two coniferous plantations: Cunninghamia konishii Hayata, planted 40 years ago (CONIF-40), and Calocedrus formosana (Florin) Florin, planted 80 years ago (CONIF-80). An adjacent natural broadleaf forest (BROAD-Nat) was used as a control. We determined microbial biomass C and N contents, enzyme activities, and community composition (via phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] assessment). Both microbial biomass and PLFA content were higher in the summer than in the winter and differed among the forests in summer only. Total PLFA, total bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, gram-negative bacterial, and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal contents followed the same pattern. Total fungal content and the ratios of fungi to bacteria and of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria were highest in CONIF-40, with no difference between the other forests. Principal component analysis of PLFA contents revealed that CONIF-40 communities were distinct from those of CONIF-80 and BROAD-Nat. Our results suggest that vegetation replacement during reforestation exerts a prolonged impact on the soil microbial community. The understory broadleaf shrubs and trees established after coniferous plantation reforestation may balance out the effects of coniferous litter, contributing to bacterial recovery.","[Chang, Ed-Haun] Mackay Jr Coll Med Nursing & Management, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Chen, Tsai-Huei; Hsu, Chun-Kai] Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Taipei 10066, Taiwan; [Tian, Guang-long] Metropolitan Water Reclamat Dist Greater Chicago, Monitoring & Res Dept, Environm Monitoring & Res Div, Chicago, IL 60804 USA; [Chiu, Chih-Yu] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Chiu, CY (reprint author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",edhaun@yahoo.com.tw; thchen@tfri.gov.tw; tiang@mwrd.org; dakai0327@tfri.gov.tw; bochiu@sinica.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2621-B-001-005]; Academia SinicaAcademia Sinica - Taiwan","This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 104-2621-B-001-005) and by Academia Sinica.",,51,9,9,1,20,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4907,,,FORESTS,Forests,OCT,2016,7,10,,,,,,,244,10.3390/f7100244,,,14,Forestry,Forestry,ED2JQ,WOS:000388670800034,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Valyi, K; Mardhiah, U; Rillig, MC; Hempel, S",,,,"Valyi, Kriszta; Mardhiah, Ulfah; Rillig, Matthias C.; Hempel, Stefan",,,Community assembly and coexistence in communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,ISME JOURNAL,,,English,Review,,,,,,,MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SPECIES RICHNESS; NETWORK THEORY; HOST PLANTS; COMPETITION; PATTERNS; COLONIZATION; GRASSLAND; ECOSYSTEM,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are asexual, obligately symbiotic fungi with unique morphology and genomic structure, which occupy a dual niche, that is, the soil and the host root.

In this paper we adapted modern coexistence and assembly theory to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We review research on the elements of community assembly and coexistence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, highlighting recent studies using molecular methods. By addressing several points from the individual to the community level where the application of modern community ecology terms runs into problems when arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are concerned, we aim to account for these special circumstances from a mycocentric point of view. We suggest that hierarchical spatial structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities should be explicitly taken into account in future studies. The conceptual framework we develop here for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is also adaptable for other host-associated microbial communities.","[Valyi, Kriszta; Mardhiah, Ulfah; Rillig, Matthias C.; Hempel, Stefan] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Ecol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Valyi, Kriszta; Mardhiah, Ulfah; Rillig, Matthias C.; Hempel, Stefan] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany","Hempel, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Ecol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",stefan.hempel@fu-berlin.de,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",BMBF through the BonaRes initiative (INPLAMINT); DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 6183/1-1]; Freie Universitat Berlin,"We thank the editor, two reviewers and W Zheng for their valuable comments.

However, our understanding of the patterns and drivers of soil microbial communities remains limited. This study aims to test the hypothesis that edaphic factors are more important in explaining variations in soil microbial communities than climatic and biotic factors, as soils directly provide substrates and environment for soil microbial communities. LocationTibetan alpine grasslands and global terrestrial biomes. MethodsOn the basis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, we investigated large-scale patterns and drivers of soil microbial communities using data obtained from 196 sites within two major grassland types (alpine steppe and alpine meadow) on the Tibetan Plateau. We also explored global patterns of soil microbial communities by analysing published data from around the world. ResultsSoil microbial PLFAs in Tibetan alpine grasslands were positively associated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation (MAP), contradicting patterns previously observed across global biomes. A combined stepwise regression and variation partitioning analysis revealed that soil microbial community variations in Tibetan alpine grasslands were mainly explained by edaphic factors, such as soil organic carbon, C:N ratio, pH and soil texture, then by biotic factors, such as aboveground biomass and plant species richness, and further by climatic factors, such as MAP. The global analysis confirmed that edaphic factors accounted for a greater portion of the variation in soil microbial communities than did climatic and biotic variables. Main conclusionsThese results provide strong support for the hypothesis that edaphic factors are the dominant drivers of spatial variations in soil microbial communities across regional and global scales.","[Chen, Yong-Liang; Ding, Jin-Zhi; Peng, Yun-Feng; Li, Fei; Yang, Gui-Biao; Liu, Li; Qin, Shu-Qi; Fang, Kai; Yang, Yuan-He] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jin-Zhi; Li, Fei; Yang, Gui-Biao; Liu, Li; Qin, Shu-Qi; Fang, Kai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Yang, YH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yhyang@ibcas.ac.cn,"Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011",,"National Basic Research Program of China on Global ChangeNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954001, 2015CB954200]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31322011, 41371213, 41501265]; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Collaboration Team; Thousand Young Talents ProgramChinese Academy of Sciences","We thank two anonymous referees for their insightful comments on the manuscript.

These compounds vary among species, and an understanding of this variation may provide generality in predicting the susceptibility of forest trees to belowground enemies and the quality of their organic matter input to soil. Here, we investigated phylogenetic patterns in the root chemistry of species within the genus Eucalyptus. Given the known diversity of PSMs in eucalypt foliage, we hypothesized that (i) the range and concentrations of PSMs and carbohydrates in roots vary among Eucalyptus species, and (ii) that phylogenetic relationships explain a significant component of this variation. To test for interspecific variation in root chemistry and the influence of tree phylogeny, we grew 24 Eucalyptus species representing two subgenera (Eucalyptus and Symphyomyrtus) in a common garden for two years. Fine root samples were collected from each species and analyzed for total phenolics, condensed tannins, carbohydrates, terpenes, and formylated phloroglucinol compounds. Compounds displaying significant interspecific variation were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny and tested for phylogenetic signal. Although all targeted groups of compounds were present, we found that phenolics dominated root defenses and that all phenolic traits displayed significant interspecific variation. Further, these compounds displayed a significant phylogenetic signal. Overall, our results suggest that within these representatives of genus Eucalyptus, more closely related species have more similar root chemistry, which may influence their susceptibility to belowground enemies and soil organic matter accrual.","[Senior, John K.; Potts, Brad M.; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M.] Univ Tasmanias, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Davies, Noel W.] Univ Tasmania, Cent Sci Lab, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wooliver, Rachel C.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.; Bailey, Joseph K.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA","Senior, JK (reprint author), Univ Tasmanias, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",jksenior@utas.edu.au,"Davies, Noel W/J-7714-2014; Potts, Brad M/C-6489-2013; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/J-7275-2014","Davies, Noel W/0000-0002-9624-0935; Potts, Brad M/0000-0001-6244-289X; O'Reilly-Wapstra, Julianne M/0000-0003-4801-4412; Wooliver, Rachel/0000-0002-7723-437X","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP120102889, LP120200380]",We thank Hugh Fitzgerald for assistance in the sampling of root material and assistance with laboratory work.

Herbicide applications controlling the undergrowth may increase erosion potential and carbon export by decreasing plant and litter cover. Quantitative evaluation of the erodibility of rubber systems and the impact of herbicides has not been studied. This study aimed at assessing the impact of herbicide application on soil loss and the induced carbon export in a rubber plantation. Runoff, sediment yield, and total organic carbon (TOC) content in sediments were measured under natural rainfall for one year in a 12-year old rubber plantation subjected to three different herbicide treatments: i) standard application twice per year practiced by the majority of farmers (Hs); (ii) no application to maintain a high understory plant cover (H-); and (iii) bimonthly application (adopted by some farmers) in order to largely avoid understory plant cover (H+). The infiltration rate under different treatments was measured with a rainfall simulator. Monthly measurements of fine root density using soil coring, surface cover, and understory plant cover making photography were carried out. The highest soil and TOC in sediment losses (425 g m(-2), 15 g C m(-2) respectively) were observed under H+ treatment, while under H - treatment they were strongly reduced (50 g m(-2) and 2 g C m(-2) respectively). Compared to Hs, H+ increased soil and sediment TOC loss by 34 and 52%, while H - reduced soil and TOC loss, both by 82%. Notably, H presented high conservation efficiency, reducing sediment yields by 86% for highly erosive rainfall events. The cover and management (C) factor and support practice factor (P) are essential components of the common Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model. We combined the Cand P factors into a single value (CP) and, for the first time, derived estimations of annual CP values for a rubber plantation (0.005-0.04) using our data. The dynamic change of the CP factor of plantations during the rainy season was quantified by relating relative soil loss to changes in understory plant cover (PC), which can be expressed as CP = 0.04-.028PC (R-2 = 0.88, P < 0.0001). Understory plant cover as affected by herbicide application was thus a key factor controlling the soil loss of established rubber systems. This suggests options to improve the soil conservation and biodiversity through reduced herbicide management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Little information is available, however, about effects of earthworm invasions outside of temperate and boreal forests, particularly about invasions of islands. For San Clemente Island (SCI), California (USA) - an oceanic island with numerous endemic and endangered plant and vertebrate species - we assessed the spatial extent and drivers of earthworm invasion and examined relationships between earthworms and plant and soil microbial communities. Location San Clemente Island, southern California, USA. Methods Using a stratified random sampling approach, we sampled earthworms, vegetation, soils and microbial communities across SCI. We examined the relationship between the presence of invasive earthworms and soil and landscape variables using logistic regression models and implemented a spatial representation of the best model to represent potential site suitability for earthworms. We evaluated the relationship between invasive earthworms and vegetation and microbial variables using ANOVA. Results We found that the likelihood of encountering earthworms increased close to roads and streams and in high moisture conditions, which correspond to higher elevation and a north-eastern aspect on SCI. The presence of earthworms was positively associated with total ground vegetation cover, grass cover and non-native plant cover; however, there was no significant relationship between earthworms and microbial biomass. These results suggest that the earthworm invasion on SCI is at an early stage and closely tied to roads and high moisture conditions. Main conclusions Climatic variables and potential sources of earthworm introduction and dispersal (e.g. roads and streams) should be broadly useful for predicting current and future sites of earthworm invasions on both islands and continents. Furthermore, the significant positive relationship between non-native plant cover and invasive earthworm presence raises the possibility of an emerging invasional 'meltdown' on SCI. Additional study of earthworm invasions on human-inhabited oceanic islands is necessary to identify additional invasions and their potential for negative impacts on unique insular biota.","[Paudel, Shishir; Wilson, Gail W.

Stump harvesting results in a direct removal of stump and coarse-root carbon (C) from the stand and can cause extensive soil disturbance, which has been suggested to increase C mineralization. In this study, the effects of stump harvesting on soil C and nitrogen (N) mineralization, and soil surface disturbance were studied in two different clear-felled Norway spruce (Picea abies) sites in Central Finland. The treatments were whole-tree harvesting (WTH, removal of stems and logging residues), and WTH and stump harvesting (WTH + S). Both sites, Honkola (2 stands) and Haukilahti (6 stands) were mounded. In both treatments, soil samples were taken from different soil layers down to a total depth of 20 cm in the mineral soil from (i) mounds, (ii) undisturbed soil and (iii) pits. The sampling was performed 11-12 years after treatments. Soil C and N mineralization rates were determined in laboratory incubation experiments. In addition, total C and N pools (g m(2)) were estimated for each disturbance class and soil layer. Soil C and N pools had a tendency to be lower following stump harvesting, but no statistically significant treatment effect was detected. Stump harvesting increased soil mixing as indicated by a significant decrease in C concentration in the mound disturbance class. There was no significant effect of stump harvesting on soil C mineralization rates. A combination of mineralization rates and soil pool data showed that field C mineralization (g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) did not significantly differ between stands where stumps were removed or were retained. Further, stump harvesting did not seem to have any stimulating effect on soil CO2 efflux 11-12 years after treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Root length density (RLD) in the soil layer close to the saline shallow groundwater decreased. Soil aeration was the key point for reduction in RLD by decreasing SGD that was intensified by the increase in WS. It is concluded that root of quinoa was sensitive to anaerobic soil conditions. Results showed that the mean value of leaf water potential () dropped from -1.53 to -3.09MPa by increasing WS from 10 to 40dS m(-1). Increasing WS from the lowest to the highest level resulted in 48% decrease in leaf photosynthesis rate (A(n)). Results revealed that leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)) was more sensitive to salinity than A(n). Stomatal closure in quinoa started to occur when the value fell below approximately -1.0MPa.

We surveyed the literature for intact forest or grassland watersheds globally, in which several metrics of nitrogen availability have been measured. Our metrics included the following: foliar delta N-15, soil delta N-15, net nitrification, net N mineralization, and the ratio of dissolved inorganic to organic nitrogen (DIN : DON) in soil solution and streams. We were particularly interested in whether terrestrial and stream based proxies for N availability were correlated where they were measured in the same place. Not surprisingly, the strongest correlation (Kendall's tau) was between net nitrification and N mineralization (tau = 0.71, p < 0.0001). Net nitrification and N mineralization were each correlated with foliar and soil delta N-15 (p < 0.05). Foliar and soil delta N-15 were more tightly correlated in tropical sites (tau = 0.68, p < 0.0001), than in temperate sites (tau = 0.23, p = 0.02). The only significant correlations between terrestrial-and water-based metrics were those of net nitrification (tau = 0.48, p = 0.01) and N mineralization (tau = 0.69, p = 0.0001) with stream DIN : DON. The relationship between stream DIN : DON with both net nitrification and N mineralization was significant only in temperate, but not tropical regions. To our surprise, we did not find a significant correlation between soil delta N-15 and stream DIN : DON, despite the fact that both have been used to infer spatially or temporally integrated N status. Given that both soil delta N-15 and stream DIN : DON are used to infer long-term N status, their lack of correlation in watersheds merits further investigation.","[Almaraz, Maya; Porder, Stephen] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Almaraz, M (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",maya_almaraz@brown.edu,,,NIH IMSDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R25GM083270]; NSF DDIGNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GR5260021]; NSF EARNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1331841],"We want to thank J.

Persistent respiration activities during drought periods are responsible for a significant carbon loss, which may turn the ecosystem from a sink into a source of carbon. There are still gaps in our knowledge regarding the characteristic changes taking place in the respiration of the different components of the ecosystem in response to drought events. In the present study, we combined a physical separation of soil respiration components with continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux and its isotopic (C-13) signals at a dry grassland site in Hungary. The physical separation of soil respiration components was performed by means of inox meshes and tubes inserted into the soil. The root-excluded and root- and mycorrhiza-excluded treatments served to measure the isotopic signals of the rhizospheric, mycorrhizal fungi and heterotrophic components, respectively. In the dry grassland investigated in the study the three components of the soil CO2 efflux decreased at different rates under drought conditions. During drought the contribution made by the heterotrophic components was the highest (54 +/- 8 %; mean +/- SE). Rhizospheric component was the most sensitive to soil drying with its relative contribution to the total soil respiration dropping from 66 +/- 7 (non-stressed) to 35 +/- 17%(mean +/- SE) under drought conditions. According to our results the heterotrophic component of soil respiration is the major contributor to the respiration activities during drought events in the dry grassland ecosystem studied.","[Balogh, Janos; Nagy, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Bot & Ecophysiol, Godollo, Hungary; [Papp, Marianna; Pinter, Krisztina; Foti, Szilvia; Nagy, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, MTA SZIE Plant Ecol Res Grp, Godollo, Hungary; [Posta, Katalin] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Plant Protect, Godollo, Hungary; [Eugster, Werner] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Grassland Sci Grp, Zurich, Switzerland","Balogh, J (reprint author), Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Bot & Ecophysiol, Godollo, Hungary.",balogh.janos@mkk.szie.hu,"Balogh, Janos/E-5460-2012; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010","Balogh, Janos/0000-0003-3211-5120; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Nagy, Zoltan/0000-0003-2839-522X",Research Centre of Excellence [11476-3/2016/FEKUT]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences; Gabor Baross Programme [REG-KM-09-1-2009-0029];  [OTKA-PD 100575];  [OTKA-PD 105944];  [KTIA_AIK_12-1-2012-0012],"The authors are grateful to the editor and to the three reviewers who provided constructive comments and suggestions that improved the paper.

Forest edges are exposed to a different microclimate in terms of air and soil temperature, light availability, soil moisture and wind speed than the forest interior. Furthermore, forest edges catch more atmospheric deposition, due to obstruction of the wind profile causing advection and turbulent exchange. Coniferous forest types are subjected to higher N deposition due to their higher Leaf Area Index (LAI), evergreen character and higher collecting efficiency of needles compared to leaves. In Europe, highest deposition values coincide with intensive livestock breeding areas, such as northern Belgium. It is still unclear how this elevated atmospheric deposition affects N and carbon (C) stocks at temperate forest edges. We assessed the N and C stocks of the aboveground (leaves/needles, wood) and belowground (forest floor, coarse and fine roots, mineral soil) forest pools along edge-to-interior transects in six forests, located in Belgium (two oak and two pine forests) and in Denmark (two spruce forests) on sandy haplic podzols. The total stocks increased towards the forest edge by 30% for N and 43% for C, averaged over all forests, within a confidence interval of 95% (which was in some cases rather wide). The aboveground wood stocks increased by 56% for N and C, the root stocks by 48% for N and C and the mineral soil stocks increased by circa 30% for N and C. Soil C sequestration (calculated via a static N balance based on N throughfall and leaching) increased at the forest edges, being on average 646 and 289 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the forest edge and interior, respectively. Forest type effects were less prominent than edge effects, with no amplified edge effect on N and C stocks in the coniferous forest types. Nevertheless, our results show the importance of incorporating forest edges when monitoring C storage on a landscape scale. The question arises, however, how much longer such forest edges will continue to accrue additional C when subjected to continuously high atmospheric N deposition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Deep rooted shrubs such as greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) are partially dependent on this groundwater to meet plant water needs. To assess the impact of a falling water table on greasewood, we monitored evapotranspiration, reference evapotranspiration and precipitation, along with daily groundwater levels for 6.2 years. Groundwater levels declined 130 cm in a highly linear fashion (p<0.001) over this period. Groundwater oscillations ceased in 2007 followed by a 2225-day quiescent period but then returned to daily oscillations late in 2013 for a 32-day period. The oscillation signature in 2013 coincided with the water level transitioning from sediment with 89% sand to a new horizon with only 8% sand. In 2013, we detected a soil water content depression at both 800 and 900 cm starting in early May that lasted 137 days, ending prior to the groundwater oscillation period when significant rainfall occurred in late August and early September. Soil water storage increase in the surface zone during the active growing period of 2013 was highly correlated (R-2 = 0.77, p<0.001) to changes in the lower unsaturated zone, suggesting a link between soil water storage zones based on precipitation and plant water extraction. Although the water table declined below 10.7m and groundwater decoupling did not occur, the current rate of decline driven solely by groundwater pumping for the irrigation of alfalfa fields would suggest extensive pumping for diversion outside of the basin would not be sustainable with regard to maintaining healthy greasewood plants that have a finite rooting depth.

In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate variables related to BNF and oxidative metabolism in the nodules of cowpea inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. and grown in soils subjected to different levels of composted tannery sludge amendment. A randomized block design was used with a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, involving four doses of composted tannery sludge (0, 5, 10, and 20 t ha(-1)) for uninoculated cowpea and cowpea inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. The cowpea inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. showed a better growth response than the cowpea inoculated with native rhizobia. Increases in the number of nodules, nodule dry mass, nitrogen fixation efficiency and nitrogen content were recorded in the cowpea inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. grown in soils with composted tannery sludge. The cowpea nodules colonized by Bradyrhizobium sp. showed lower hydrogen peroxide levels, while leghemoglobin was maintained at the highest levels. The catalase and phenol peroxidase enzymes were positively modulated in the nodules of the cowpea inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp. We conclude that the presence of composted tannery sludge affects the establishment and development of the symbiosis between rhizobia and cowpea, mainly between native soil rhizobia and cowpea. When cowpea was inoculated with Bradyrhizobium sp., it was concluded that these plants were able to maintain better plant growth and nitrogen capture and lower oxidative stress in their nodules. Thus, inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp. could be a useful tool for minimizing the deleterious effects of exposing plants to composted tannery sludge and for ensuring plant growth and productivity.

It was found that the higher concentrations of the stress factors lengthened the generation time and, additionally, in the case of sucrose and PEG, caused entry of the cells into the viable but nonculturable state (VBNC). The presence of the osmoprotectant, glycine betaine (GB), significantly decreased the effects of stress induced by KCl, sucrose, and PEG, as indicated by reduction of the generation time of A. cicer isolates, an increase in the proportion of living to dead cells in comparison to bacteria under stress conditions but in the absence of GB. We also investigated the ability of A. cicer symbionts to form biofilm in the different stress conditions. It was demonstrated that PEG enhanced biofilm formation, whereas KCl and sucrose at higher concentrations negatively affected this process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Therefore, we examined whether PSF effects of several native and invasive plant species occur also in the field and influence plant damage by above-ground herbivores. Root zone soil from an abandoned urban field was used as inocula for the PSF experiment. First, we grew eight urban grassland plant species (five natives and three invasive species) separately in a glasshouse, with soil biota communities conditioned by the respective species itself (home soil') or by a mixture of all other species (foreign soil'). After 13weeks, one cohort of the plants was placed on an urban field in Berlin to assess damage by naturally colonizing herbivores, while another cohort of the plants stayed in the glasshouse. We observed that the extent of the PSF effects differed between the field and glasshouse cohorts of plants. While we found positive PSF responses for five of the eight plant species in the glasshouse, we found no PSF effects in the field. Further, there was no trend that invasive or native species differed in the direction or extent of PSF responses. Concerning the leaf damage by herbivores of the field plants, we found no evidence that the soil history (home vs. foreign soil) affected the effects of above-ground herbivores on the plants.Synthesis. We conclude that PSF effects are more likely to be found under glasshouse conditions. In the field, PSFs seem to play a minor role for the selected urban grassland species. More generally, our study highlights the need to focus on PSFs under natural conditions and in natural communities (including higher trophic levels), which is often overlooked in PSF research.","[Schittko, Conrad; Runge, Christian; Strupp, Marek; Wolff, Sascha; Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Funct Biodivers, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Schittko, C (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Funct Biodivers, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",conrad.schittko@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,47,9,11,1,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

These hypotheses are often used to infer competitive dynamics from trait patterns within communities. However, plant traits are frequently plastic in response to competition. This variation is poorly accounted for in trait-based studies of competition and community assembly. To explore the relationship between trait responses and competitive outcomes, we grew 15 species alone, in monoculture and in mixture. We measured traits relating to leaf and root tissue morphology as well as biomass allocation and related competition-induced changes in these traits to intra- and interspecific competition using multi-model inference. Additionally, we tested how traits from different competitive environments influenced potential community assembly inferences. The competitive environment had large effects on species' traits, although many effects were species specific. Differences among species in how competition affected trait expression were linked to both intra- and interspecific competition, frequently affecting competitive hierarchies. Intraspecific competition was lower for species that limited competition-induced increases in root allocation and had less variability in this trait overall. Interspecific competition was lower for species with larger leaves and lower specific leaf area than their neighbours. Switching to more stress-tolerant strategies by increasing root diameter and leaf tissue density also reduced competition. However, dissimilarity in root tissue density also minimized competition, consistent with limiting similarity affecting competitive outcomes. Moreover, changes in these traits were linked to changes in functional diversity, suggesting that competition affects functional diversity by affecting trait expression.Synthesis. Both trait hierarchies and trait dissimilarity affect the outcome of competition by acting on different traits, although competition-induced changes in trait expression can alter competitive outcomes. Moreover, the magnitude of these trait changes suggests that the source environment where plant traits are collected can affect the inferences drawn from trait patterns within communities. Combined, our results suggest that considering the effect of competition on trait expression is critical to understanding the relationship between traits and community assembly.","[Bennett, Jonathan A.; Riibak, Kersti; Tamme, Riin; Lewis, Rob J.; Partel, Meelis] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Bennett, Jonathan A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; [Tamme, Riin] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Lewis, Rob J.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.; Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",jon.a.bennett@gmail.com,"Partel, Meelis/D-5493-2012","Partel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138","Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [PUTJD15]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT20-29]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange)","This study was supported by Estonian Research Council postdoctoral research grant PUTJD15, the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research, institutional research funding IUT20-29 and the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange).",,52,19,19,8,118,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

While effects of single strong droughts on plant and microbial carbon (C) dynamics have been studied in some detail, impacts of recurrent drought events are still little understood. We tested whether the legacy of extreme experimental drought affects responses of plant and microbial C and nitrogen (N) turnover to further drought and rewetting. In a mountain grassland, we conducted a C-13 pulse-chase experiment during a naturally occurring drought and rewetting event in plots previously exposed to experimental droughts and in ambient controls (AC). After labelling, we traced C-13 below-ground allocation and incorporation into soil microbes using phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers. Drought history (DH) had no effects on the standing shoot and fine root plant biomass. However, plants with experimental DH displayed decreased shoot N concentrations and increased fine root N concentrations relative to those in AC. During the natural drought, plants with DH assimilated and allocated less C-13 below-ground; moreover, fine root respiration was reduced and not fuelled by fresh C compared to plants in AC. Regardless of DH, microbial biomass remained stable during natural drought and rewetting. Although microbial communities initially differed in their composition between soils with and without DH, they responded to the natural drought and rewetting in a similar way: gram-positive bacteria increased, while fungal and gram-negative bacteria remained stable. In soils with DH, a strongly reduced uptake of recent plant-derived C-13 in microbial biomarkers was observed during the natural drought, pointing to a smaller fraction of active microbes or to a microbial community that is less dependent on plant C.Synthesis. Drought history can induce changes in above- vs. below-ground plant N concentrations and affect the response of plant C turnover to further droughts and rewetting by decreasing plant C uptake and below-ground allocation. DH does not affect the responses of the microbial community to further droughts and rewetting, but alters microbial functioning, particularly the turnover of recent plant-derived carbon, during and after further drought periods.","[Fuchslueger, Lucia; Kienzl, Sandra; Watzka, Margarete; Richter, Andreas] Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Bahn, Michael; Hasibeder, Roland; Fritz, Karina; Schmitt, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Fuchslueger, Lucia] Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Ave Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Fuchslueger, L (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Fuchslueger, L (reprint author), Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Ave Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",lucia.fuchslueger@univie.ac.at,"Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013; Richter, Andreas/D-8483-2012; Fuchslueger, Lucia/E-6687-2012","Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Richter, Andreas/0000-0003-3282-4808; Fuchslueger, Lucia/0000-0002-9615-4439","Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P22214-B17]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [226701]; Faculty of Life Science, University of Vienna","We want to thank Eric Walter, Sanni Turunen, Rene Schader, Mario Deutschmann and Thomas Ladreiter-Knauss for their valuable assistance during experimental set-up and <SUP>13</SUP>CO<INF>2</INF> pulse labelling, as well as Irene Cordero and Anna Knoltsch for help during laboratory analyses and Jaspar Bloemen for helpful comments on the manuscript.

We conducted an experiment in a 10-year-old H. ammodendron plantation forest to determine the influence of physical properties of duplex soil on water infiltration and plant root growth. We used a trenching method to assess root biomass, and classified roots into two diameter classes: fine (< 2 mm) and coarse (> 2 mm). Following a 26.7 mm rain event, water infiltrated to the B- horizon; further deep percolation was hindered by low hydraulic conductivity, so that B horizon remained at high available soil moisture for an extended period of time. Root biomass increased rapidly in, or very close to the B horizon, especially for coarse roots. The subsoil formed a barrier to root penetration, but may also reflect the accumulation of water resources at the boundary between the A- and B-horizon. Shoot growth and root distribution, shrub height and canopy area, and total root biomass were negatively correlation with depth to the B horizon, and that was reflected by quadratic functions. We conclude that the texture and structure of duplex soils influenced the soil environment for water infiltration and storage, indicating that the B-horizon underlying sand in duplex soils is advantageous for the growth, and development of planted sand-stabilizing vegetation. These results have important implications for sustainable development of sand-fixing plantations in desert ecosystems.","[Zhou, Hai; Zhao, Wenzhi; Yang, Qiyue] Chinese Acad Sci, Linze Inland River Basin Res Stn, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lab Inland River Ecohydrol, 320 Donggang West Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China","Zhao, WZ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Linze Inland River Basin Res Stn, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lab Inland River Ecohydrol, 320 Donggang West Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",zhaowzh@lzb.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Funds of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41501577]; Key Project of Chinese National Programs (973 Program) for Fundamental Research and Development [2013CB429903],This study was supported by the National Natural Science Funds of China (Grant No. 41501577) and the Key Project of Chinese National Programs (973 Program) for Fundamental Research and Development (Grant No. 2013CB429903).

These plants will encounter new biotic communities beyond their range edges, and the net outcome of these encounters could profoundly affect colonization success. However, little is known about how biotic interactions vary across range edges and this has hindered efforts to predict changes in species distributions in response to climate change. In contrast, a rich literature documents how biotic interactions within species ranges vary according to distance to and density of conspecific individuals. Here, we test whether this framework can be extended to explain how biotic interactions differ beyond range edges, where conspecific adults are basically absent. To do so, we planted seven species of trees along a 450-km latitudinal gradient that crossed the current distributional range of five of these species and monitored foliar disease and invertebrate herbivory over 5 yr. Foliar disease and herbivory were analyzed as a function of distance to and density of conspecific and congeneric trees at several spatial scales. We found that within species ranges foliar disease was lower for seedlings that were farther from conspecific adults for Acer rubrum, Carya glabra, Quercus alba, and Robinia pseudoacacia. Beyond range edges, there was even less foliar disease for C. glabra, Q. alba, and R. pseudoacacia (A. rubrum was not planted outside its range). Liriodendron tulipifera did not experience reduced disease within or beyond its range. In contrast, Quercus velutina displayed significant but idiosyncratic patterns in disease at varying distances from conspecifics. Patterns of distance dependent herbivory across spatial scales was generally weak and in some cases negative (i.e., seedlings farther from conspecific adults had more herbivory). Overall, we conclude that differences in biotic interactions across range edges can be thought of as a spatial extension to the concept of distance dependent biotic interactions. This framework also provides the basis for general predictions of how distance dependent biotic interactions will change across range edges in other systems.","[Katz, Daniel S.

Different biomass allocation patterns were found, and males were shown to have a larger investment into coarse roots and foliage. Sexual dimorphism in differences of reproductive costs between genders has been widely reported for trees, but we still know little about allometric relationships between tree components in both genders. We present biomass allocation patterns and relationships between components of the androdioecious A. tegmentosum in a broad-leaved mixed forest in northeastern China. The objectives of this study were to examine how gender affects the biomass structure of androdioecious species and how the gender-related reproductive efforts affect the allometric relationships. We harvested 31 hermaphrodite and 29 male A. tegmentosum trees and opted for diameter at breast height, tree height, and crown length as the independent variables and various biomass components as the dependent variables. Five types of function were used to model allometry equations. Biomass allocation between genders was different, and the best biomass model for each biomass component varies between genders. Males have a higher investment in foliage and coarse root biomass than hermaphrodites, and hermaphrodites invested more in reproduction than males. Biomass equations are strongly gender-related. Males tended to invest a larger fraction of the vegetative biomass into leaves and coarse roots.","[Zhang, Xinna; Zhang, Chunyu; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Zhao, XH (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh@bjfu.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BLYJ201608]; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41330530]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2011CB403203],"This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Nos.

AS plant functional diversity is expected to stabilize ecosystem functions, we tested whether mixing species with contrasting root systems could improve the resilience of Mediterranean grasslands under increasing aridity. We hypothesized that root functional identity (RFI) and diversity (RFD) respectively determines and improves soil water uptake capacity, aboveground biomass (AGB) production and resilience after drought stress (=post-stress AGB/pre-stress AGB). Monocultures, two- and three Species mixtures of two groups of perennial grasses (cultivars and native species) were compared in a twin 3-years field experiment under two levels of summer drought in southern France. RFI and RFD were assessed as the mean and variance of multiple root traits (rooting depth, deep root mass fraction, root tissue density, root diameter and specific root length) measured in species monocultures. AGB and resilience were assessed from annual harvests; total transpirable soil water (TTSW) and evapotranspiration in summer (ET_sum) were assessed through the monitoring of soil water content. For both groups of species, RFI was a major predictor of TTSW and resilience, but not of AGB or ET_sum. Greater water uptake, especially from deep soil layers, increased resilience. Rooting depth distribution determined the potential depth of water uptake while root morphology influenced the precision of water uptake along the soil profile. However, RFD only marginally improved AGB production and resilience, although long-term effects of RFD should be tested. Designing artificial plant communities under water limited conditions should therefore prioritize the maximization of rooting depth and root distribution along the soil profile. Diversifying root morphological traits associated with resource acquisition could also have a positive impact. The similarity of results between cultivars and native species suggests that agro-ecological guidelines for species assembly can be based on advances of functional ecology in natural ecosystems.

However, the effects of differences in soil moisture levels at different depths and humidity index involved MAT and MAP on plant diversity have received only scant attention. To determine effects of soil moisture and humidity index on both plant productivity and diversity of native grasslands on the Loess Plateau, China, a gradient analysis of soil moisture and above- and below-ground properties of plant communities showed that vegetation cover and above- and below-ground biomass were significantly and positively correlated to the levels of soil moisture. More specifically, the below ground biomass was significantly and positively correlated to moisture in the top 10 cm layer of soil, whereas plant height, litter biomass, and root-to-shoot ratio were unrelated to the level of soil moisture. Plant diversity (richness index and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index) was significantly and positively correlated to a greater degree with moisture in the topsoil (0-5 cm layer) than in the subsoil, and was also closely correlated to the humidity index. Overall, changes in plant diversity in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems are closely determined by soil moisture and atmospheric humidity, and that higher moisture content in soil and higher atmospheric humidity favour greater plant diversity.

Yet, we know little about the effects of restoration methods on AM fungi. We examined how using herbicide and mowing to remove invasive Brassica nigra (black mustard) might alter AM abundance in a coastal sage scrubland. Black mustard is a non-mycorrhizal plant that produces allelochemicals that inhibit AM fungi. Although black mustard removal could potentially improve AM growth, herbicide and mowing might harm AM fungi. We measured black mustard cover, AM hyphal abundance, and native plant cover from plots exposed to either herbicide or mowing versus untreated controls. We found that both herbicide and mowing reduced black mustard cover. Furthermore, herbicide increased AM abundance in one field site, potentially because herbicide killed black mustard roots and reduced allelochemical production. However, neither restoration treatment improved native plant abundance over the course of our study. Overall, herbicide can deter black mustard invasion and help re-establish the AM community in certain ecosystems, but without a corresponding increase in native plants.","[Maltz, Mia R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Ayala Sch Biol Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Bell, Carl E.] Univ Calif Cooperat Extens, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Mitrovich, Milan J.] Nat Communities Coalit, Irvine, CA 92618 USA; [Iyer, Adithi R.] Woodbridge High Sch, Irvine, CA 92604 USA; [Treseder, Kathleen K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Maltz, MR (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Ayala Sch Biol Sci, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mmaltz@uci.edu,,,Mycological Society of America fellowship; UCI Center for Environmental Biology,"We are sincerely grateful for initial field experimental design by K.

Mycorrhizae are considered drivers of ecosystem processes in boreal forests, which represent some of the most taxon rich arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) habitats in the world. Methods of inoculating gold mine overburden with AM were evaluated in this study during a 17-week greenhouse trial. Soil inoculation with a commercial strain of Rhizophagus irregularis and the indigenous AM community, isolated from re-vegetated mine rock spoil piles on the mine property, each resulted in increased root colonization and biomass in C. canadensis, E. macrophylla, and F. virginiana. There was no significant difference in the increase in plant biomass between the commercial product and indigenous AM community. When examining the plant community, the commercial AM had greater average hyphal (p = 0.006) and vesicular (p = 0.001) root colonization than the indigenous AM treatment. However, there was no significant variation in arbuscule colonization (p > 0.05) in the plant community following applications of commercial and indigenous AM. The findings suggest that the growth and survival of boreal plant species in mine overburden appears to benefit from AM associations, as the non-AM treatments had very little growth. To our knowledge, this is the first study to date that has contrasted the application of a commercial and indigenous AM community for the restoration of a boreal understory plant community. The results of this study serve as a practical indication that soil inoculation with AM can benefit boreal understory plant growth when applied as an amendment to boreal mine overburden.","[Rapai, Sean B.; Newmaster, Steven G.] Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hunt, Shelley] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Bainard, Luke D.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Semiarid Prairie Agr Res Ctr, Swift Current, SK S9H 3X2, Canada; [Turgeon, Marie-Helene] Detour Gold Corp, Reg Off, Cochrane, ON P0L 1C0, Canada","Rapai, SB (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Ctr Biodivers Genom, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sean.rapai@gmail.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Detour Gold Corporation; Ontario Centres of Excellence,"This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Detour Gold Corporation and Ontario Centres of Excellence.

The extent to which native and invasive species are competing via limiting similarity or trait hierarchies has important implications for the management of invaded communities. We screened 47 native species that co-occur with Festuca perennis, a dominant invader in California serpentine grassland, for traits pertaining to resource use and acquisition. We then grew F. perennis with 10 species spanning a range of functional similarity in pairwise competition trials. Functionally similar species did not have a strong adverse effect on F. perennis performance as would be expected by limiting similarity theory. Phylogenetic relatedness, which may integrate a number of functional traits, was also a poor predictor of competitive outcome. Instead, species with high specific root length, low root-to-shoot biomass ratio, and low leaf nitrogen concentration were more effective at suppressing the growth of F. perennis. Our results suggest that fitness differences (i.e., trait hierarchies) may be more important than niche differences (i.e., limiting similarity) in structuring competitive outcomes in this system and may be a promising approach for the restoration of invaded systems.","[Funk, Jennifer L.] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Wolf, Amelia A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Funk, JL (reprint author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",jlfunk@chapman.edu,,,Jasper Ridge Restoration Fellowship from Stanford University,"We thank N.

Productivity of mixed-species systems is ultimately the net result of positive and negative interactions among the component species. Despite increasing knowledge of positive interactions occurring in mixed-species tree systems, relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying such interactions. Based on data from 25-year-old experimental stands in situ and a series of controlled experiments, we test the hypothesis that a broadleaf, non-N fixing species, Michelia macclurei, facilitates the performance of an autotoxic conifer Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) through belowground chemical interactions. Chinese fir roots released the allelochemical cyclic dipeptide (6-hydroxy-1,3-dimethyl-8-nonadecyl-[1,4]-diazocane-2,5-diketone) into the soil environment, resulting in self-growth inhibition, and deterioration of soil microorganisms that improve P availability. However, when grown with M. macclurei the growth of Chinese fir was consistently enhanced. In particular, Chinese fir enhanced root growth and distribution in deep soil layers. When compared with monocultures of Chinese fir, the presence of M. macclurei reduced release and increased degradation of cyclic dipeptide in the soil, resulting in a shift from self-inhibition to chemical facilitation. This association also improved the soil microbial community by increasing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and induced the production of Chinese fir roots. We conclude that interspecific interactions are less negative than intraspecific ones between non-N fixing broadleaf and autotoxic conifer species. The impacts are generated by reducing allelochemical levels, enhancing belowground mutualisms, improving soil properties, and changing root distributions as well as the net effects of all the processes within the soil. In particular, allelochemical context alters the consequences of the belowground ecological interactions with a novel mechanism: reduction of self-inhibition through reduced release and increased degradation of an autotoxic compound in the mixed-species plantations. Such a mechanism would be useful in reforestation programs undertaken to rehabilitate forest plantations that suffer from problems associated with autotoxicity.","[Xia, Zhi-Chao; Kong, Chui-Hua] China Agr Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Long-Chi; Wang, Peng; Wang, Si-Long] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","Kong, CH (reprint author), China Agr Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",kongch@cau.edu.cn,"Wang, Peng/C-4029-2008; Kong, Chui-Hua/G-6002-2011; Chen, Long-Chi/D-9983-2017","Wang, Peng/0000-0002-0629-8835; Kong, Chui-Hua/0000-0002-8405-3083; Chen, Long-Chi/0000-0003-1608-1987; zhi chao, xia/0000-0001-6715-8986","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [30671663, 31171865]","We sincerely thank Scott J.

We found that local fungal diversity increased with forest area, whereas fungal species composition was correlated with fragment connectivity. Fragment size and connectivity were significant predictors even when we included environmental covariates, which were also associated with fungal diversity and composition. Fungal species composition was more similar among highly connected fragments than among poorly connected ones. We also identified individual taxa that varied in abundance with connectivity.

However, plant fine roots and soil fauna can both be either excluded from the soil within fine mesh bags or admitted into the soil without mesh bags or within coarse mesh bags, because of their similar ranges of body width. As a result, both their effects could be influenced by fine mesh bags. In this study, we investigated the effects of soil fauna and understory fine roots on soil organic carbon, with a special type of fine mesh bags designed for obstructing the growth of understory fine roots into soil with free access of soil fauna. Results showed that both the biomass of understory fine roots and soil faunal diversity along with soil total carbon and microbial biomass carbon were significantly reduced by the fine mesh bags (P < 0.01). Boosting regression tree models showed that the understory fine roots contributed more in the variations of soil organic carbon than soil faunal properties. Faunal biodiversity represented by Pielou's evenness index was more important than taxa richness and individual abundances of taxa. Results suggest that understory fine roots may be more influential in soil organic carbon than faunal factors, and both their functions could be influenced by fine mesh bags in a mesh bag study. Evenness of individual abundances between taxa could be more important than taxa richness for the influence of soil fauna community on soil organic carbon.

Here we evaluate the mycorrhizal status, symbiotic germination and protocorm development of the species. Plant material including capsules, roots and whole plant were collected from two natural populations. Symbiotic germination was tested using one fungal endophyte isolated from C. riojana and four fungal endophytes previously isolated from the sympatric orchid species Aa achalensis. Three isolates were able to promote seed germination and further development into plantlets with 1-2 leaves after 16 weeks of in vitro dual culture. Moreover, the strain isolated from C riojana developed intense melanized coilings and pelotons inside protocorms, a rare feature not observed before. These findings contribute to the general knowledge about the orchid mycorrhiza in the subtribe Chloraeinae, and open an opportunity for the conservation not only of this particular species, but also of other rare and poorly known Andean terrestrial orchids.

Recently, research focus has shifted to below-ground mechanisms of invasion, which has provided valuable insights into the role of soil microbes in the invasion process. Research on how soil microbes drive plant invasions has produced a multitude of potential mechanisms and hypotheses, and we have taken this timely opportunity to organize these hypotheses, explore interrelations among them and with other drivers of invasion and identify areas requiring more in-depth study.Synthesis. This special feature brings together current research on soil microbes as drivers and responders of invasion, highlighting the methods that can be used to advance our understanding of how, when and which soil microbes play a role in the invasion process.

After 175 days of growth, our results showed considerable variation in growth traits among container types while survival was generally high with an overall average of 89 %. Initial cutting diameter appeared to be an important predictor of survival and our results showed that a cutting diameter of aeyen7.5 mm increased survival rates of the tested hybrid poplar planting stock. Furthermore, containers with larger cavity volume and lower cavity density had a strong positive influence on growth and survival across nurseries (R (2) = 0.96). Growth trait interactions with container type showed that container 512A (cavity volume: 220 ml; cavity depth: 12 cm) resulted in more diameter growth across clones. Cavities with a depth of 15 cm (415D, 515A, 615A) resulted in higher root:shoot ratios than cavities with a depth of only 12 cm (412A, 512A), irrespective of cavity volume or cavity density. Lastly, our study identified Okanese as a well-rounded clone with great growth potential both above and below ground. From an operational standpoint, we found container types 512A and 515A the most cost-effective choices under the assumption that nursery space and budgets are limiting factors.","[Thomas, Barb R.; Schreiber, Stefan G.; Kamelchuk, David P.] Univ Alberta, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Kamelchuk, David P.] Little Creek Agroforestry, Box 32, Ellscott, AB T0A 1B0, Canada; [Kamelchuk, David P.] Alberta Pacific Forest Ind Inc, POB 8000, Boyle, AB T0A 0M0, Canada","Thomas, BR (reprint author), Univ Alberta, 442 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",bthomas@ualberta.ca,"; Schreiber, Stefan/N-9843-2015","Thomas, Barb R./0000-0002-9718-9297; Schreiber, Stefan/0000-0001-5033-8884","Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc., (Al-Pac)","The authors would like to thank Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc., (Al-Pac) for financial support of this work and Joanna Ramsum from Al-Pac and Dan McCurdy and Larry Lafleur from Coast to Coast Reforestation for their time and effort on this trial.

The aims of this study were to determine whether drought-induced die-off and forest succession were reflected in soil respiration and its components and to determine the influence of climate on the soil respiration components. We used the mesh exclusion method to study seasonal variations in soil respiration (R-S) and its components: heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A) [further split into fine root (R-R) and mycorrhizal respiration (R-M)] in a mixed Mediterranean forest where Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is undergoing a drought-induced die-off and is being replaced by holm oak (Quercus ilex L.). Drought-induced pine die-off was not reflected in R-S nor in its components, which denotes a high functional resilience of the plant and soil system to pine die-off. However, the succession from Scots pine to holm oak resulted in a reduction of R-H and thus in an important decrease of total respiration (R-S was 36 % lower in holm oaks than in non-defoliated pines). Furthermore, R-S and all its components were strongly regulated by soil water content-and-temperature interaction. Since Scots pine die-off and Quercus species colonization seems to be widely occurring at the driest limit of the Scots pine distribution, the functional resilience of the soil system over die-off and the decrease of R-S from Scots pine to holm oak could have direct consequences for the C balance of these ecosystems.","[Barba, Josep; Poyatos, Rafael; Lloret, Francisco] CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Barba, Josep; Lloret, Francisco] UAB, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Curiel Yuste, Jorge] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Janssens, Ivan A.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium","Barba, J (reprint author), CREAF, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain.; Barba, J (reprint author), UAB, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain.",j.barba@creaf.uab.cat,"Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Poyatos, Rafael/F-8305-2010; Lloret, Francisco/H-2711-2015; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/A-6438-2011","Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Poyatos, Rafael/0000-0003-0521-2523; Barba, Josep/0000-0001-9094-9516; Lloret, Francisco/0000-0002-9836-4069; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/0000-0002-3221-6960","Spanish governmentSpanish Government [CGL2009-08101, CGL2010-16373, CGL2010-22180-C03-03, CGL2012-32965, CGL2013-42271-P]; Government of CataloniaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2009-SGR-00247, 2014-SGR-453]; Community of MadridComunidad de Madrid [2 (CM S2009/AMB-1783)]; FPI scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2010-036558]; EEBB scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [EEBB-I-13-07002]","The authors thank I.

We conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the influence of reduced extraradical hyphal lengths on interplant HRW transfer. Ectomycorrhizal Pinus halepensis saplings and seedlings were grown together in two-compartment mesocosms (fungicide-treated or control), and deuterium-labeled water was supplied to the taproot compartment (accessible to sapling taproots) during a 9-day soil drying cycle. Upper soil water contents and seedling water potentials at the end of the drying cycle were lower in fungicide-treated than in control mesocosms. The stem water delta D values of seedlings increased (marginally) with increasing soil hyphal length in both treatments separately, suggesting that interplant HRW transfer was at least partly mediated by fungal hyphae. In fungicide-treated mesocosms, the difference in delta D values between the stem water of seedlings and upper soil water decreased sharply with increasing soil hyphal length, supporting a key role of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) in interplant HRW transfer at low soil hyphal densities. However, two dominant EMF morphotypes differing in their water repellence properties and hyphal exploration types (Thelephora terrestris and Suillus granulatus) had contrasting impacts on hydraulic redistribution patterns, as only the EMF producing hydrophilic hyphae (T. terrestris) enhanced HRW transfer between pine saplings and seedlings. Changes in the abundance and/or composition of EMF communities in response to anthropogenic disturbance or climate change could affect facilitative plant interactions through alterations of interplant HRW transfer.","[Prieto, Ivan; Roldan, Antonio; del Mar Alguacil, Maria; Querejeta, Jose I.] CSIC, CEBAS, Campus Univ Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Huygens, Dries] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Navarro-Cano, Jose A.] Ctr Invest Desertificac CSIC UVEG GV, Carretera Moncada Naquera,Km 4-5, Valencia 46113, Spain","Querejeta, JI (reprint author), CSIC, CEBAS, Campus Univ Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",querejeta@cebas.csic.es,"Prieto, Ivan/S-7822-2016; Roldan, Antonio/F-6241-2013; Querejeta, Jose I/B-6297-2008; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/M-3859-2014; Huygens, Dries/A-8395-2008; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/L-8281-2013","Prieto, Ivan/0000-0001-5549-1132; Querejeta, Jose I/0000-0002-9547-0974; del Mar Alguacil, Maria/0000-0001-8495-8707; Huygens, Dries/0000-0003-2423-6926; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8091-1063","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN) [CGL2010-21064]; ""Juan de la Cierva"" program of the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [FPDI-2013-16221]","This work was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Reference Grant number CGL2010-21064).

In many ecosystems, including the heath/grassland system studied here, increased plant production at elevated CO2 increase fresh C input from litter and root exudates to the soil and concurrently decrease soil N availability. Supply of labile C to the soil may accelerate the decomposition of soil organic C (SOC), a phenomenon termed the priming effect', and the priming effect is most pronounced at low soil N availability. Hence, we hypothesized that priming of SOC decomposition in response to labile C addition would increase in soil exposed to long-term elevated CO2 exposure. Further, we hypothesized that long-term warming would enhance SOC priming rates, whereas drought would decrease the priming response. We incubated soil from a long-term, full-factorial climate change field experiment, with the factors elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, warming and prolonged summer drought with either labile C (sucrose) or water to assess the impact of labile C on SOC dynamics. We used sucrose with a signature that is distinct from that of the native SOC, which allowed us to assess the contribution of these two C sources to the CO2 evolved. Sucrose induced priming of SOC, and the priming response was higher in soil exposed to long-term elevated CO2 treatment. Drought tended to decrease the priming response, whereas long-term warming did not affect the level of priming significantly. We were also able to assess whether SOC-derived primed C in elevated CO2 soil was assimilated before or after the initiation of the CO2 treatment 8 years prior to sampling, because CO2 concentrations were raised by fumigating the experimental plots with pure CO2 that was C-13-depleted compared to ambient CO2. Surprisingly, we conclude that sucrose addition primed decomposition of relatively old SOC fractions, i.e. SOC assimilated more than 8 years before sampling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Karst.) frequently over-yield, when compared to respective monospecific stands. Over-yielding is attributed to enhanced resource uptake efficiency through niche complementarity alleviating species competition, for example through enhanced root stratification in mixture. Under severe and frequent summer drought, however, water limitation may become crucial in modifying the prevailing competitive interaction in mixed beech-spruce forests. We hypothesize, therefore, that under drought (H I) inter-specific interaction with beech reduces water accessibility for spruce more than intra-specific conditions, thus (H II) exacerbating drought susceptibility of spruce in terms of reduced photosynthesis and stem growth. Reactions at the organ (leaf, fine root), tree and stand scale were analysed in a mature forest with beech-spruce group mixture. Under inter-specific conditions spruce's fine-root production and depth of water uptake (assessed via delta O-18 of xylem water) shifted to shallow, drought-prone soil horizons, in agreement with H I. Overall, lowered fine root production and ramification along with a reduction in long-distance explorative ectomycorrhizal types resulted in decreased soil exploitation in spruce when growing together with beech. Spruce's drought sensitivity was exemplified by a distinct decrease in stomatal conductance, net CO2 uptake rate and stem growth during periods of water limitation. Notwithstanding, species interaction effects were absent in leaf gas exchange and stem diameter growth, during a six-week summer drought period in 2013 as well as in the extremely dry year of 2003, hence rejecting H II. Based on results from soil moisture measurements and water uptake depth, we interpret the conflicting findings for H I and H II to result from: (i) seasonal shifts between positive (during spring drought) and negative (during summer drought) effects of beech neighbourhood on soil water availability for spruce, possibly overriding each other in their effect on annual stem diameter growth and (ii) the group -wise mixture pattern, where spruce is exposed to competition with beech only along group edges, i.e. laterally only, so that the putatively adverse beech effect on water accessibility stays limited. Our results suggest, compared to single tree mixture, group -wise mixture of beech and spruce to be a favourable silvicultural option in the face of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although shade treatments significantly affected seedling growth, they did not influence seedling survival. Both growth and biomass increased as light intensity increased. Diameter growth of oak seedlings was higher than that of beech. Beech and oak seedlings showed typical acclimation to shade, including greater specific leaf area and height to diameter ratios, and lower leaf thickness and root:shoot ratios with increasing shade. Beech seedlings exhibited greater specific leaf area, and lower leaf thickness and root:shoot ratios than oak seedlings. In spite of the greater growth at full sunlight, the results from this study suggest that beech and oak seedlings would have high survival rates and would acclimate well if underplanted below overstories that reduce the available light to as low as 28% of full light.

Red mangroves are major foundation species at the land-sea interface, creating critical habitat in the tropics and subtropics. The complex aerial roots of mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) provide structural support to the tree and support diverse marine biota including boring isopods (Sphaeroma terebrans). These isopods frequently bore into root tips of mangroves causing atrophy, which can alter the structure and extent of mangrove habitat. We conducted a large-scale isopod exclusion experiment across 18 degrees of latitude at eight locations from Panama to Florida to test how isopods affect mangrove root structure and anchorage across a broad geographic range. We hypothesized that excluding isopods would increase root growth rates, morphological complexity, and anchorage compared to roots exposed to isopods. After one year, mangrove roots protected from boring isopods with cages increased growth by 2.5-19 times and exhibited a more complex morphology compared to uncaged controls. Further, 15% of caged roots became anchored in the sediment compared to none of the uncaged isopod-inhabited roots. This suggests that these isopods, which are native to the Indo-Pacific, are a major, widespread structuring agent of mangrove root habitat in the Caribbean and Florida, potentially limiting mangrove encroachment into estuarine waters.","[Davidson, Timothy M.; Torchin, Mark E.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Box 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama; [Ruiz, Gregory M.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Davidson, Timothy M.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Biol Sci, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA","Davidson, TM (reprint author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Box 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama.; Davidson, TM (reprint author), Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Biol Sci, 6000 J St, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",Davidson@csus.edu,,"Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",National Science Foundation Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship [OCE-PRF 1323429]; Smithsonian Institution Marine Science Network Postdoctoral Fellowship,"We are grateful for the field, laboratory, and logistical support provided by Andrew Sellers, Carmen Schloeder, and Amanda Fenner.

However, the role of cell walls in leaf freezing resistance and the coordination between leaf and stem physiological processes under subzero temperatures are not well understood. We studied leaf and stem responses to freezing temperatures, leaf and stem supercooling, leaf bulk elastic modulus and stem xylem vessel size of six Patagonian shrub species from two sites (plateau and low elevation sites) with different elevation and minimum temperatures. Ice seeding was initiated in the stem and quickly spread to leaves, but two species from the plateau site had barriers against rapid spread of ice. Shrubs with xylem vessels smaller in diameter had greater stem supercooling capacity, i.e., ice nucleated at lower subzero temperatures. Only one species with the lowest ice nucleation temperature among all species studied exhibited freezing avoidance by substantial supercooling, while the rest were able to tolerate extracellular freezing from -11.3 to -20 degrees C. Leaves of species with more rigid cell walls (higher bulk elastic modulus) could survive freezing to lower subzero temperatures, suggesting that rigid cell walls potentially reduce the degree of physical injury to cell membranes during the extracellular freezing and/or thaw processes. In conclusion, our results reveal the temporal spatial ice spreading pattern (from stem to leaves) in Patagonian shrubs, and indicate the role of xylem vessel size in determining supercooling capacity and the role of cell wall elasticity in determining leaf tolerance of extracellular ice formation.","[Zhang, Yong-Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yong-Jiang] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia S.; Scholz, Fabian G.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Bucci, Sandra J.; Arias, Nadia S.; Scholz, Fabian G.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Grp Estudios Biofis & Ecofisiol GEBEF, Dept Biol, RA-9000 Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina; [Hao, Guang-You] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Cao, Kun-Fang] Guangxi Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Key Lab, Minist Educ Microbial & Plant Genet Engn,Coll For, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, POB 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Goldstein, Guillermo] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Zhang, YJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Zhang, YJ (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Goldstein, G (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, POB 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.; Goldstein, G (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",yongjiangzhang@oeb.harvard.edu; goldstein@bio.miami.edu,"Cao, Kun-Fang/D-2157-2009","Cao, Kun-Fang/0000-0002-2253-7189",NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (PIP grant); NATIONAL AGENCY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLGY PROMOTION- FUND FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHONOLIGAL RESEARCH (ANCyT-FONCyT); NATIONAL AGENCY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLGY PROMOTION- FUND FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHONOLIGAL RESEARCH (PICT grant),This study was partially supported by NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (CONICET; PIP grant) and NATIONAL AGENCY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLGY PROMOTION- FUND FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHONOLIGAL RESEARCH (ANCyT-FONCyT; PICT grant).,,65,4,4,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2016,36,8,,,,,1007,1018,,10.1093/treephys/tpw036,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,DY7EG,WOS:000385291800008,27217529,,,,10/31/19J,"Simpson, AH; Richardson, SJ; Laughlin, DC",,,,"Simpson, Angela H.; Richardson, Sarah J.; Laughlin, Daniel C.",,,"Soil-climate interactions explain variation in foliar, stem, root and reproductive traits across temperate forests",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bark thickness; flowering phenology; leaf economic spectrum; mean annual temperature; plant strategies; root traits; seed mass; soil fertility; vapour pressure deficit; wood density,NEW-ZEALAND; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; LEAF TRAITS; RAIN-FOREST; PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; SHADE-TOLERANCE; BARK THICKNESS; PLANT TRAITS; SEED MASS; GRADIENTS,"Aim The individual effects of climate and soil properties on functional trait distributions have become increasingly clear with recent syntheses of large datasets. However, the distribution of traits in a given climate may depend on the fertility of the soil. Our aim was to quantify how soil-climate interactions explain community-level variation in functional traits from every plant organ to improve predictions of plant community responses to environmental change. Location Temperate forests throughout New Zealand. Methods We measured traits of foliar, stem, root and reproductive tissue for 64 species and calculated abundance-weighted mean trait values on 324 forest plots. Multiple linear regression was used to model the variation in each of the traits as functions of mean annual temperature (MAT), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil pH, soil total phosphorus (P) and their interactions. Results Soil-climate interactions explained significant variation in functional traits. For example, specific leaf area (SLA) was highest in high-P soil within a wet and warm climate; however, strong interactions indicate that SLA was lowest in wet and warm climates in low-P soil. Root tissue density was lowest in warm climates and high-P soil, but it was high in warm climates and low-P soil and in cold climates and high-P soil. According to model predictions, the largest potential responses of vegetation to warming may occur in fertile and wet environments. Main conclusions Pervasive soil-climate interactions demonstrate that interpreting simple bivariate relationships between traits and climate must be done with caution because the adaptive value of traits in a given climate depends on the fertility of the soil. Predictions of vegetation responses to climate change will improve significantly by incorporating local-scale soil properties into modelling frameworks. Rising global temperatures may shift community-level trait values in opposite directions depending on whether the soil is fertile or infertile.","[Simpson, Angela H.; Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Simpson, Angela H.; Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Richardson, Sarah J.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand","Laughlin, DC (reprint author), Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.; Laughlin, DC (reprint author), Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",d.laughlin@waikato.ac.nz,,,"Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [UOW1201]; University of Waikato Research Scholarship; New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation GroupNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE)","This research was supported by a grant (UOW1201) from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund, a University of Waikato Research Scholarship and core funding for Crown Research Institutes from New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's Science and Innovation Group.

In this study, we focused on the ggm gene (locus tag, AZC_4606) that encodes a putative membrane protein belonging to the TIGR02302 family. Although the genes encoding TIGR02302 family protein are distributed in a wide range of alpha-proteobacteria including rhizobia, the functions of this protein are still unknown. To investigate the functions of this protein in A. caulinodans, we made a ggm mutant, and analyzed its phenotypes. The ggm mutant produced more bubbles than the wild-type strain in L3+N medium liquid cultures, and formed mucoid colonies on L3+N medium agar plates, suggesting that the ggm mutant overproduced exopolysaccharides (EPSs). The amounts of EPSs produced by the ggm mutant on L3+N plates were about 1.3-fold higher than those by the wild-type strain, and expression levels of EPS production-related genes in the ggm mutant grown in L3+N liquid medium were about 2- to 4-fold higher than those of the wild-type strain. In addition, the stem nodules formed by the ggm mutant on the stems of S. rostrata showed little or no nitrogen-fixing activity. By microscopic analyses, large infection pockets and a few infected cells were observed in the stem nodules formed by ggm mutant, suggesting that the ggm mutant is defective in invasion into plant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Ggm is involved in EPS production and that adequate levels of EPS production are required for A. caulinodans to invade into host cells.","[Sato, Satoru; Siarot, Lowela; Matsuoka, Jun-ichi; Aono, Toshihiro; Oyaizu, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan","Aono, T (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo, Japan.",uaono@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23780061, 25450081]",This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [grant nos. 23780061 and 25450081].,,26,1,1,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0038-0768,1747-0765,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Thus far, however, there is no consensus regarding the variations in soil respiration caused by stand age and forest type. This study investigated soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity at three stand ages (5, 10, and 20 or 30 years) in two plantations of coniferous (Pinus tabulaeformis Carrisre) and deciduous (Populus davidiana Dode) species using an automated chamber system in 2013 in the Beijing-Tianjin sandstorm source area. Results showed that mean soil respiration in the 5-, 10-, and 20/30-year-old plantations was 3.37, 3.17, and 2.99 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) for P. tabulaeformis and 2.92, 2.85, and 2.57 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) for P. davidiana, respectively. Soil respiration decreased with stand age for both species. There was no significant difference in soil respiration between the two plantation species at ages 5 and 10 years (p > 0.05). Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, which ranged from 1.85-1.99 in P. tabulaeformis and 2.20-2.46 in P. davidiana plantations, was found to increase with stand age. Temperature sensitivity was also significantly higher in P. davidiana plantations and when the soil water content was below 12.8%. Temperature sensitivity incorporated a combined response of soil respiration to soil temperature, soil water content, soil organic carbon, and fine root biomass and, thus, provided an ecological metric for comparing forest carbon dynamics of these species.","[Zhao, Xin; Li, Fadong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wanjun; Ai, Zhipin; Liu, Xiuping; Cao, Jiansheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Key Lab Agr Water Resources,Hebei Key Lab Agr Wat, Shijiazhuang 050021, Peoples R China; [Shen, Huitao] Hebei Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci, Shijiazhuang 050011, Peoples R China; [Manevski, Kiril] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Zhao, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Li, FD (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Zhang, WJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Ctr Agr Resources Res, Key Lab Agr Water Resources,Hebei Key Lab Agr Wat, Shijiazhuang 050021, Peoples R China.",zhaox.14b@igsnrr.ac.cn; lifadong@igsnrr.ac.cn; wjzhang1211@163.com; zpai@sjziam.ac.cn; shenht80@126.com; xiupingliusjz@163.com; jianshengcao73@126.com; kiril.manevski@agro.au.dk,"Ai, Zhipin/C-2081-2011; Manevski, Kiril/C-5601-2016","Ai, Zhipin/0000-0002-7991-3640; Manevski, Kiril/0000-0003-2068-3040","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31170414]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [41201514, XDA05060600]","We are greatly thankful for the help provided by Shiqi Lian and Changbai Liu with the field data collection.

In this study, we utilized a field-based tree experiment in Minnesota, USA, to assess the effect of changes in plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity on the richness and composition of both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness was significantly positively influenced by increasing plant phylogenetic diversity, while saprotrophic fungal species richness was significantly affected by plant leaf nitrogen content, specific root length and standing biomass. The increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal richness associated with increasing plant phylogenetic diversity was driven by the combined presence of ectomycorrhizal fungal specialists in plots with both gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Although the species composition of both the ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities changed significantly in response to changes in plant species composition, the effect was much greater for ectomycorrhizal fungi. In addition, ectomycorrhizal but not saprotrophic fungal species composition was significantly influenced by both plant phylum (angiosperm, gymnosperm, both) and origin (Europe, America, both). The phylum effect was caused by differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, while the origin effect was attributable to differences in community heterogeneity. Taken together, this study emphasizes that plant-associated effects on soil fungal communities are largely guild-specific and provides a mechanistic basis for the positive link between plant phylogenetic diversity and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness.","[Nguyen, Nhu H.; Vincent, John B.; Kennedy, Peter C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Williams, Laura J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Kennedy, Peter C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Stefanski, Artur; Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Messier, Christian; Paquette, Alain] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada","Kennedy, PC (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.; Kennedy, PC (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",kennedyp@umn.edu,"Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,70,29,29,4,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

While the mechanisms are difficult to determine, soil conditioning may modify other plants performance and their interaction with other organisms. We aim to determine the extent to which aboveground EpichloA << endophytes and consumers induce legacy effects on subsequent plants and their interactions with floral visitors. We performed two mesocosm experiments in two phases. Firstly, annual ryegrass plants (Lolium multiflorum), in symbiosis or not with EpichloA << occultans and subjected or not to grazing, were grown in mesocoms to generate four soil conditionings. Secondly, thistle plants (Carduus acanthoides) were grown in these conditioned soils. We assessed thistle plants aerial biomass, number of flower heads and their floral visitors. The presence of one or both interactions (symbiosis and grazing) reduced total visits in subsequent thistle plants by 45 %. In particular, honeybees and other bees were reduced by 42 and 51 %, respectively. The flower head number or biomass of thistle plants may only partially mediate these effects. To better understand the rules structuring communities and ecological processes, it is critical to connect multiple interactions effects on soil conditions and their influence on trophic and non-trophic interactions during the subsequent generations.","[Casas, Cecilia] Univ Buenos Aires, Catedra Edafol, Ave San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Pablo Torretta, Juan] Univ Buenos Aires, Catedra Bot Gen, Ave San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Omacini, Marina] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Catedra Ecol, IFEVA CONICET, Ave San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Exeler, Nina] Univ Osnabrueck, Div Ecol, Dept Biol Chem, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Pablo Torretta, Juan] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Casas, C (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Catedra Edafol, Ave San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ccasas@agro.uba.ar,,,"DAAD/SECYTDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnologia (SECYT) [DA0602]; CONICET-ANPCyT (PICT); Ecology Department of Faculty of Agronomy, University of Buenos Aires","We thank Till Eggers for his continued support of this work, Beatriz Santos for the English language edition and, Maria Semmartin and Luis Ignacio Perez for their comments on the manuscript.

Here we explored the effect of the asexual fungal symbiont, EpichloA << occultans, on the interaction between Lolium multiflorum host plants and soil pathogens, and its potential positive side-effect on neighbouring plants. We conducted two microcosm experiments to assess the endophyte effect on seedling establishment of the host grass and other non-symbiotic grasses in the presence of soil pathogens. With an in-vitro experiment, we tested whether the endophyte inhibits, during seed germination, the growth of these pathogens. Independently of pathogen identity, the endophyte improved host establishment (6 %). The endophyte also enhanced the establishment of the neighbouring grass Bromus catharticus (ae20 %) only in soil with Rhizoctonia solani. The endophyte in seed reduced the growth (ae20 %) of two out of four pathogens (Fusarium acuminatum and R. solani). We conclude that asexual endophytes could protect host grasses against pathogens but most importantly, that they can have protective effects beyond their hosts. Since effects depended on pathogen and plant identity, more experiments are needed in order understand the ecological meaning of these positive side-effects.","[Perez, L. I.; Gundel, P.

This means that, in addition to uncertainty in classification, evolutionary patterns in vegetative structure and mycorrhizal diversity in the family have also been uncertain. This study analyzes nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial sequence data in order to provide a basis for classification and character analysis. Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of partitioned and combined data are largely in agreement; organellar data differ from nuclear data with respect to the position of pyroloids. Based on nuclear, plastid and combined data analyses, monotropoids are sister to arbutoids, and these are together sister to pyroloids, and thence to a core Ericaceae and finally to Enkianthus. This suggests that a reduction in woodiness and increased mycotrophy has occurred in parallel in pyroloids and monotropoids and that the arbutoid and ericoid mycorrhizal types were each derived from the arbuscular type in Ericaceae.","[Freudenstein, John V.; Broe, Michael B.; Feldenkris, Emily R.] Ohio State Univ, Herbarium, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43212 USA","Freudenstein, JV (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Herbarium, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",freudenstein.1@osu.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842076],"We thank the following institutions and inviduals for providing material: Holden Arboretum, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, University of California, Davis, Arboretum (provided by Daniel Potter) and Alvin Diamond.

Invasive earthworms have the potential to alter soil C dynamics, though mechanisms and effects remain poorly understood. To investigate potential effects of invasive earthworms on forest C, the forest floor, mineral soil, fine root biomass, litterfall and microbial litter decay rates, and total soil respiration (TSR) over a full year were measured at an invaded and uninvaded deciduous forest site in southern Ontario. The uninvaded site was approximately 300 m from the invaded site and a distinct invasion front between sites was present. Along the invasion front, the biomass of the forest floor was negatively correlated with earthworm abundance and biomass. There was no significant difference between litterfall, microbial litter decay, and TSR between the invaded and uninvaded sites, but fine root biomass was approximately 30% lower at the invaded site. There was no significant difference in total soil C pools (0-30 cm) between the invaded and uninvaded sites. Despite profound impacts on forest floor soil C pools, earthworm invasion does not significantly increase TSR, most likely because increased heterotrophic respiration associated with earthworms is largely offset by a decrease in autotrophic respiration caused by lower fine root biomass.","[Jennings, Bradley Wayne] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Watmough, Shaun A.] Trent Univ, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Watmough, SA (reprint author), Trent Univ, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada.",swatmough@trentu.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors would like to thank Michele Williamson from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, for providing additional soil temperature data.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, AMF abundance and species richness in soils were assessed in adjacent plots with invaders and native vegetation. We also quantified the performance (expressed as shoot mass, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the concentration of elements in shoots) of two common, mycorrhizal native plants, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens, grown in these soils. The invasions of R. japonica, R. laciniata, and S. gigantea influenced AMF communities compared to native vegetation, but the changes depended on the mycorrhizal status of invaders. The effects of non-mycorrhizal R. japonica were the most pronounced. Its invasion reduced AMF abundance and species richness. In the plots of both mycorrhizal plants, R. laciniata and S. gigantea, we observed decreased AMF species richness in comparison to native vegetation. The AMF community alterations could be due to (i) depletion of organic C inputs to AMF in the case of R. japonica, (ii) plant secondary metabolites that directly inhibit or selectively stimulate AMF species, or (iii) changes in soil physicochemical properties induced by invasions. The effect of invasion on AMF abundance and species richness did not generally differ between valley and outside-valley habitats. The invasions affected photosynthetic performance and the concentrations of elements in the shoots of P. lanceolata or T. repens. However, the directions and magnitude of their response depended on both species identity and the mycorrhizal status of invaders.","[Zubek, Szymon; Majewska, Marta L.; Nobis, Marcin] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Fac Biol & Earth Sci, Kopernika 27, PL-31501 Krakow, Poland; [Baszkowski, Janusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Dept Ecol Protect & Shaping Environm, Slowackiego 17, PL-71434 Szczecin, Poland; [Stefanowicz, Anna M.; Kapusta, Pawe] Polish Acad Sci, W Szafer Inst Bot, Lubicz 46, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland","Zubek, S (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Fac Biol & Earth Sci, Kopernika 27, PL-31501 Krakow, Poland.",szymon.zubek@uj.edu.pl,,"Nobis, Marcin/0000-0002-1594-2418; Stefanowicz, Anna/0000-0003-1803-6872; Kapusta, Pawel/0000-0002-9126-5068; Majewska, Marta/0000-0002-5243-1211; Zubek, Szymon/0000-0003-1338-9572","Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2011/03/B/NZ8/00008, 2012/05/B/NZ8/00498, 2012/07/N/NZ8/02363]; Institute of Botany at the Jagiellonian University [K/DSC/002941]","We are grateful to Malgorzata Stanek for her help with the laboratory work.

Water deficit affects tracheid differentiation in conifers. However, the signals, which transmit the information of water contents in the soil to the differentiating tracheid, remain unknown. Plant responses with deficits of macronutrients or water showed some differences but also similarities, mostly involving hormonal long-distance signaling. In Arabidopsis, trans-zeatin (tZ)-type cytokinins play a role as a root-to-shoot acropetal signal. In this study, we report the effects of applying tZ alone or in combination with other phytohormones on tracheid differentiation in mature sugi trees forming latewood. The application of tZ induced the formation of earlywood-type tracheids with significantly smaller cell wall ratios and larger microfibril angles than those of controls in July, August and September. The application of indole acetic acid (IAA) in combination with tZ inhibited the effects of applied tZ, although gibberellic acid (GA3) did not. In October and November, application of tZ could not affect the xylem formation or dormancy of cambium.

Both techniques are used to achieve rapid multiplication of trees with favorable genetic combinations and to capture a large proportion of the genetic diversity in a single generation cycle. However, adventitious rooting of shoots (cuttings) is often not efficient due to various problems, such as scarcity of roots and cessation of their growth, both of which limit the application of vegetative propagation in some conifer species. Many factors are involved in the adventitious rooting of shoots, including physical and chemical ones, such as plant growth regulators, carbohydrates, light quality, temperature and rooting substrates, or media [reviewed by Ragonezi et al. (Trees 24(6):975-992, 2010)]. The focus of this review is on biological factors, such as inoculations with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria and other endophytes, and mycorrhizal fungi, which were found to stimulate adventitious rooting. These microorganisms could contribute not only to adventitious root development but also to help in protecting conifer plants against pathogenic microorganisms, facilitate acclimation and transplanting, and contribute to more sustainable, chemical-free forests.","[Zavattieri, Maria Amely] Univ Evora, ICT, Evora, Portugal; [Ragonezi, Carla] Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Rodovia MGT 367,Km 583-5000, BR-39100000 Diamantina, MG, Brazil; [Klimaszewska, Krystyna] Laurentian Forestry Ctr, Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, 1055 PEPS,Stn St Foy,POB 10380, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada","Zavattieri, MA (reprint author), Univ Evora, ICT, Evora, Portugal.",zavattieri@uevora.pt,,"Zavattieri, Maria Amely/0000-0001-9640-8227; Ragonezi, Carla/0000-0002-1822-5473",,,,106,3,4,5,62,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

We analysed the diversity of putative nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB, i.e. nifH gene present) associated with five invasive legumes, four Acacia spp. and a sister taxon Paraserianthes lophantha in introduced and native range populations in Australia. We predicted that, because these host species are widely distributed, they are likely to encounter different nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in soils and nodules across their introduced and native ranges. LocationAustralia. MethodsNifH genes were amplified from rhizosphere soils collected from beneath each species (multiple populations) within their native and introduced range and directly from nodules collected from plants previously grown in the glasshouse using field-collected soil as inoculum. NifH gene sequences from soils and nodules were 454 pyrosequenced and assigned to taxonomic groups based on nifH consensus taxonomy. ResultsWe found no difference in the NFB community of soils or nodules between native and introduced ranges across the five species, suggesting that these legumes encounter similar NFB communities in soils across Australia. Bradyrhizobium was the most abundant rhizobial genus present in both soils and nodules. Bradyrhizobium species found in nodules were significantly different across the ranges for A. longifolia. Main conclusionsThe results indicate that these invasive legumes have similar nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in their rhizosphere and nodules across Australia, with the exception of A. longifolia. This species has diverse Bradyrhizobium genotypes in its nodules suggesting that A. longifolia may be a more generalist host compared to the other four legumes. Thus, it is unlikely that the invasive success of these legumes is constrained by the absence of suitable bacterial symbionts in soil. Better knowledge of legume-soil interactions could facilitate more informed and effective management of invasive legumes in their introduced ranges in Australia and elsewhere.","[Birnbaum, Christina; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Bissett, Andrew; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Agr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Birnbaum, C (reprint author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, 90 South St, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",c.birnbaum@murdoch.edu.au,"Leishman, Michelle/G-9726-2012","Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Birnbaum, Christina/0000-0002-2511-1845",Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0879494],We thank Carla Harris and Pawel Waryszak for extensive help in the field and acknowledge Luke Barrett for helpful discussions on the statistical analysis.

Nitrogen (N) deposition can enhance invasion in some ecosystems, and this could be the result of increased soil N availability as well as shifts in soil biota. In a two-phase, full-factorial greenhouse experiment, we tested effects of N availability and N-impacted soil communities on growth responses of three Mediterranean plant species invasive in California: Bromus diandrus, Centaurea melitensis, and Hirschfeldia incana. In the first phase, plants were grown individually in pots and inoculated with sterile soil, soil from control field plots or soil from high N addition plots, and with or without supplemental N. In the second phase, we grew the same species in soils conditioned in the first phase. We hypothesized growth responses would differ across species due to species-specific relationships with soil biota, but overall increased N availability and N-impacted soil communities would enhance plant growth. In the first phase, Centaurea had the greatest growth response when inoculated with N-impacted soil, while Bromus and Hirschfeldia performed best in low N soil communities. However, in phase two all species exhibited positive growth responses in N-impacted soil communities under high N availability. While species may differ in responses to soil biota and N, growth responses to soils conditioned by conspecifics appear to be most positive in all species under high N availability and/or in soil communities previously impacted by simulated N deposition. Our results suggest N deposition could facilitate invasion due to direct impacts of soil N enrichment on plant growth, as well as through feedbacks with the soil microbial community.","[Valliere, Justin M.; Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Valliere, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jvall007@ucr.edu,,,National Park Service Air Resources Division [J8C07110022],"We would like to thank Dr. Irina Irvine for field and logistical support.

Continued human population growth coupled with projected warmer and drier climate will alter the hydrologic regimes of many arid-zone rivers, including intermittent rivers. We aimed to identify (i) woody plant guilds associated with distinct stream types of an arid region and (ii) plant traits indicating adaptation to the selective pressures of water availability and fluvial disturbance. We used hierarchical clustering to identify 11 plant guilds from floodplains, terraces and uplands of eight Arizona rivers that vary in surface flow permanence, depth to ground water and intensity of fluvial disturbance. Six guilds were riparian pioneers with small, wind-dispersed seeds, three guilds were late-seral, shade-tolerant riparian taxa with large animal-dispersed seeds, and two guilds were composed of desert xerophytes. Within the riparian pioneer and seral groups, guilds varied in water acquisition and productivity traits including wood density and rooting depth. The community-weighted traits varied or covaried with water availability and fluvial disturbance. Root: shoot ratio, canopy height and leaf area were influenced strongly by water availability, with the latter two showing a nonlinear response to changes in water table depth. Leaf length increased, and wood density decreased, as sites become wetter and more fluvially disturbed. Community-weighted seed mass, seed dispersal and spinesence varied most strongly with elevation above thalweg (an indicator of decreasing fluvial disturbance). These analyses will enable prediction of changes in the relative abundance of plant types and plant traits in response to changes in stream flow regimes, such as shifts towards greater intermittency. The distribution patterns of guilds among riparian habitat types emphasise the importance of focusing conservation efforts not only on the limited number of perennial rivers remaining in arid regions, but also on intermittent and ephemeral rivers with shallow water tables.","[Stromberg, Juliet C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Merritt, David M.] US Forest Serv, Watershed Fish Air & Rare Plants, Natl Stream & Aquat Ecol Ctr, Ft Collins, CO USA","Stromberg, JC (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",jstrom@asu.edu,,,Environmental Protection Agency 'Science to Achieve Results' grant; Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program,"This study was funded by an Environmental Protection Agency 'Science to Achieve Results' grant and by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program.

As nitrogen supply has a crucial role in growth and development, higher nitrogen fixation capacity would be important to achieve bigger plants and larger seeds, which were important selection criteria during plant domestication by humans. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the nitrogen fixation-related performance in 31 cultivated and 17 wild soybeans after inoculation with the slow-growing Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens sp. nov. USDA110 and the fast-growing Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii CCBAU45436. Our results showed that, in general, cultivated soybeans gave better performance in BNF. Electron microscopic studies indicated that there was an exceptionally high accumulation of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate bodies in bacteroids in the nodules of all wild soybeans tested, suggesting that the C/N balance in wild soybeans may not be optimized for nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, we identified new quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for total ureides and total nodule fresh weight by employing a recombinant inbred population composed of descendants from a cross between a cultivated and a wild parent. Using nucleotide diversity (theta pi), divergence index (F-st) and distribution of fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms as parameters, we found that some regions in the total ureides QTL on chromosome 17 and the total nodule fresh weight QTL on chromosome 12 exhibited very low diversity among cultivated soybeans, suggesting that these were traits specially selected during the domestication and breeding process.","[Munoz, N.; Qi, X.; Li, M-W; Xie, M.; Gao, Y.; Cheung, M-Y; Wong, F-L; Lam, H-M] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Soybean Res Partner, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Munoz, N.; Qi, X.; Li, M-W; Xie, M.; Gao, Y.; Cheung, M-Y; Wong, F-L; Lam, H-M] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Munoz, N.] Inst Fisiol & Recursos Genet Vegetales, Ctr Invest Agr INTA, Cordoba, Argentina; [Munoz, N.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Catedra Fisiol Vegetal, Cordoba, Spain","Lam, HM (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Soybean Res Partner, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Lam, HM (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",honming@cuhk.edu.hk,"XIE, MIN/P-8062-2019; Lam, Hon-Ming/A-9866-2008","XIE, MIN/0000-0002-5652-5039; Lam, Hon-Ming/0000-0002-6673-8740; Munoz, Nacira/0000-0002-4792-9357; Li, Man-Wah/0000-0003-4859-5683","Hong Kong Research Grants CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [468610, AoE/M-05/12]; Lo Kwee-Seong Biomedical Research Fund; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Argentina","This work was supported by grants from Hong Kong Research Grants Council (General Research Fund: 468610; Area of Excellence: AoE/M-05/12) and Lo Kwee-Seong Biomedical Research Fund to H-ML.

In summer 2012, the presence of six vascular plants, growing in a single patch, was recorded at an unprecedented elevation of 6150 m.a.s.l. close to the summit of Mount Shukule II in the Western Himalayas (Ladakh, India). Whilst showing multiple signs of stress, all plants have managed to establish stable growth and persist for several years. To learn about the role of microbes in the process of plant upward migration, we analysed the root-associated microbial community of the plants (three individuals from each) using microscopy and tagged amplicon sequencing. No mycorrhizae were found on the roots, implying they are of little importance to the establishment and early growth of the plants. However, all roots were associated with a complex bacterial community, with richness and diversity estimates similar or even higher than the surrounding bare soil. Both soil and root-associated communities were dominated by members of the orders Sphingomonadales and Sphingobacteriales, which are typical for hot desert soils, but were different from communities of temperate subnival soils and typical rhizosphere communities. Despite taxonomic similarity on the order level, the plants harboured a unique set of highly dominant operational taxonomic units which were not found in the bare soil. These bacteria have been likely transported with the dispersing seeds and became part of the root-associated community following germination. The results indicate that developing soils act not only as a source of inoculation to plant roots but also possibly as a sink for plant-associated bacteria.","[Angel, Roey; Conrad, Ralf] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Karl von Frisch Str 10, Marburg, Germany; [Angel, Roey] Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, Vienna, Austria; [Dvorsky, Miroslav; Kopecky, Martin; Hiiesalu, Inga; Dolezal, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Kotilinek, Milan; Dolezal, Jiri] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Zlate Stoce 1, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Schweingruber, Fritz] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Angel, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Karl von Frisch Str 10, Marburg, Germany.; Angel, R (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, Vienna, Austria.",angel@microbial-ecology.net,"Angel, Roey/R-1552-2019; Kopecky, Martin/A-1466-2009","Angel, Roey/0000-0002-2804-9661; Kopecky, Martin/0000-0002-1018-9316; Hiiesalu, Inga/0000-0002-5457-2376; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051",Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology),Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society (Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology).,,85,16,16,2,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Our dataset consisted of 50 paired grassland and farmland sites in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China. We observed shifts in the relative abundance of AM fungal orders in response to climatic variables but also declines in OTU richness in grassland sites that had experienced high precipitation during the preceding year which was incongruous with the PTH. We found pronounced differences across groups of Glomeromycotan fungi in their responses to climatic variables and identified strong dependencies of AM fungal communities on precipitation. Given that precipitation is expected to further decline in the farming-pastoral ecotone over the coming years and that mycorrhiza represents an integral constituent of ecosystem functioning, it is likely that the ecosystem services in the region will change accordingly.","[Xiang, Dan; Xu, Tianle; Hao, Zhipeng; Chen, Baodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Dan; Li, Huan] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Veresoglou, Stavros D.; Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Chen, BD (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bdchen@rcees.ac.cn,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Veresoglou, Stavros D/D-5087-2011; Chen, Baodong/A-7707-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Veresoglou, Stavros D/0000-0001-6387-4109; Chen, Baodong/0000-0002-1790-7800","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371264, 41071178]; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, China [SKLURE2012-1-03]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371264; 41071178) and State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, China (SKLURE2012-1-03).",,53,4,8,5,81,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

To improve understanding of the diversity of fungi in the rhizobiome of Populus deltoides, Populus trichocarpa and co-occurring plant hosts Quercus alba and Pinus taeda, we conducted field and greenhouse studies and sampled, isolated, and characterized the diversity of culturable root-associated fungi on these hosts. Using both general and selective isolation media we obtained more than 1800 fungal isolates from individual surface sterilized root tips. Sequences from the ITS and/or D1-D2 regions of the LSU rDNA were obtained from 1042 of the >1800 pure culture isolates and were compared to accessions in the NCBI nucleotide database and analyzed through phylogenetics for preliminary taxonomic identification. Sequences from these isolates were also compared to 454 sequence datasets obtained directly from the Populus rhizosphere and endosphere. Although most of the ectomycorrhizal taxa known to associate with Populus evaded isolation, many of the abundant sequence types from rhizosphere and endosphere 454 datasets were isolated, including novel species belonging to the Atractiellales. Isolation and identification of key endorrhizal fungi will enable more targeted study of plant-fungal interactions. Genome sequencing is currently underway for a subset of our culture library with the aim of understanding the mechanisms involved in host-endophyte establishment and function.

So we explored shifts in competitive outcomes and intensities as a potential general mechanism. In a standard greenhouse experiment the temporal priority effects of the target species Pseudoroegneria spicata and its competitive responses to five receptor species, i.e., Bromus ciliatus, Bromus marginatus, Coreopsis tinctoria, Senecio atratus, and Solidago canadensis were evaluated. P. spicata adults with a high root: shoot ratio had a significant inhibitory priority effect on B. ciliatus, B. marginatus, and C. tinctoria. Compared with the target species, under later and simultaneous sowing, B. ciliatus, B. marginatus, C tinctoria, and S. atratus exhibited an increasing trend in terms of competition. However, S. canadensis did not display priority effects. In addition, the gram per gram competitive effect of P. spicata depended on the receptor species in the following order: B. marginatus > B. ciliatus > C tinctoria > S. atratus. There were positive relationships between the relative interaction indices and the root: shoot ratios in B. ciliatus, B. marginatus, and C. tinctoria, thereby suggesting that the early germination or emergence of P. spicata may reduce the root: shoot ratios of these receptors. The results of this study indicate that priority effects occurred in early colonizers with high root: shoot ratios and greater competitive capacities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The soil microbial community composition was determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The monthly in situ soil respiration rate was measured from October 2010 to September 2012. Results showed that the abundance of Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs, actinomycetal PLFAs, and total PLFAs did not vary significantly with forest conversion. The CF soil was characterized by higher abundance of fungal PLFA and lower abundance of Gram-positive bacterial PLFA compared with NF and PM soils. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the significant change in the composition of soil microbial community was mainly due to fine root biomass and soil pH. Annual soil respiration rate averaged 161.7 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in NF, 95.1 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in CF, and 103.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in PM. The NF showed significantly higher mean annual soil CO2 flux (1421 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than CF (837 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and PM (907 g C m(-2) year(-1)). After forest conversion, the apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10)) increased from 1.75 in NF to 2.04 and 1.98 in CF and PM, respectively. The mean annual soil respiration was significantly correlated with soil organic C (SOC) content and abundances of microbial PLFAs except for abundance of fungal PLFA, but not significantly correlated with fine root biomass (< 2 mm in diameter) across the different forest soils. The latter behavior may be due to the higher fine root biomass in the CF than in the NF and PM. Our results suggest that studies incorporating the microbial community composition with soil respiration may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of soil C dynamics.","[Guo, Jianfen; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Liu, Xiaofei; Chen, Guangshui; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jianfen; Yang, Zhijie; Lin, Chengfang; Liu, Xiaofei; Chen, Guangshui; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Inst Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China","Guo, JF (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.; Guo, JF (reprint author), Fujian Normal Univ, Inst Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.",jfguo@fjnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31370615, 31130013]; National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954003]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2015J01121]","This work was financed by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31370615 and 31130013), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2014CB954003), and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (2015J01121).

The aim of this study is to determine the effects of organic amendments and mulches on soil aggregate stability and aggregation-associated soil characteristics, six years after beginning experimental restoration in the Gador Mountains (Almeria, SE Spain). Experimental plots were set up to test two organic amendments (sludge and compost) and two mulches (gravel and woodchip) and their respective control plots. Soil samples from neighboring undisturbed soils were used as the quality reference threshold. The tested variables were total organic C (TOC), glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP) and water aggregate stability evaluated by both wet sieving (WS) and water-drop test (WDT). Relationships among the measured soil properties were checked in order to assess the best indicators for the most suited restoration practices. After 6 years, the results showed that the combination of organic amendments and mulches enhanced soil aggregate stability and the content of aggregate binding agents such as TOC and glomalin. Nevertheless, the role of organic amendments, especially compost, was more important than mulch treatments in increasing TOC and glomalin, showing the closest values to the undisturbed reference soils (over 30 g kg(-1) for TOC and 3.5 g kg(-1) for GRSP). Despite the considerable improvement in water stable aggregates found in sludge-amended plots (average mean weight diameter of 2.13 mm in WS, and 25-drop impacts in WDT), the reference soils provided the highest values (average mean weight diameter of 3.32 mm in WS, and 99-drop impacts in WDT). The lack of a good correlation between soil structure-related variables restricted the evaluation of the real effects of restoration treatments, and suggested considering other soil properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, hardening) associated to aggregate stability.

Understanding the processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent work has suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free-living microbial decomposers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems globally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here we show that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67% under field conditions in two separate field exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via competition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 degrees C soil warming. These findings support mycorrhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstrate the need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global climate.","[Averill, Colin; Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Averill, C (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",caverill@bu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1110007]; Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant [DEB-1401299],"CA was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-1110007) and Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DEB-1401299).

Carr) clones were grown in monoclonal (pure) and poly clonal mixtures (mixed) in a field experiment to assess effects of clonal diversity on above- and below ground growth, biomass partitioning and fine root morphology. Shoot height and root collar diameter were measured twice annually and after the second year 48 clones were destructively harvested. Fine roots were divided into 10 diameter classes, for each of which morphological characteristics were calculated from digitized images. Competitive interactions arising from deployment type were found to significantly increase fine root surface area in mixed plots and fine root length in pure plots for two fine root diameter classes for some clones. Competitive interactions were also found to significantly alter relationships between above- and below-ground variables and reduce the strength and significance of relationships among root traits in mixed plots. Significant inter-clonal variation for many above- and below-ground parameters was also observed. The two most productive clones, in terms of height and diameter growth, differed significantly in biomass partitioning suggesting that a high degree of variation occurs among Sitka spruce clones, which may affect stand productivity and uniformity.

The specific respiration (a ratio of respiration to biomass) is increasingly being used as an indicator of forest succession conceptually based on Odum's theory of ecosystem development. However, the hypothesis that specific soil respiration declines with forest succession remains largely untested. We used a trenching method to partition soil respiration into heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration (R-H and R-A) and then evaluated the specific R-H and specific R-A in three successional forests in subtropical China. Our results showed a clear seasonality in the influence of forest succession on R-H, with no significant differences among the three forests in the dry season but a higher value in the old-growth forest than the other two forests in the wet season. R-A in the old-growth forest tended to be the highest among the three forests. Both the specific R-H and specific R-A decreased with the progressive maturity of three forests. Our results highlight the importance of forest succession in determining the variation of R-H in different seasons. With forest succession, soil microbes and plant roots become more efficient to conserve C resources, which would result in a greater proportion of C retained in soils.","[Huang, Wenjuan; Han, Tianfeng; Liu, Juxiu; Zhou, Guoyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gangsheng] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst & Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Zhou, GY (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",gyzhou@scib.ac.cn,"Huang, Wendy/X-1221-2018; Wang, Gangsheng/F-8940-2012","Wang, Gangsheng/0000-0002-8117-5034","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400382, 41430529]",This study was jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 31400382 and 41430529).

Three levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal status of plant species could be defined: (1) obligate arbuscular mycorrhizal species that are always colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, (2) facultative arbuscular mycorrhizal species that are colonised under some conditions but not colonised under others and (3) non-mycorrhizal species that are never found to be colonised by mycorrhizal fungi. We aimed to investigate whether plant species assemblages at the studied grid cell scale are composed of different proportions of species regarding their arbuscular mycorrhizal status, and whether the variation of these proportions can be linked to the geographical variation of ecological and environmental factors. We fitted a vector generalised additive model (VGAM) for log-ratios of proportions of plant species' arbuscular mycorrhizal status per grid cell (2859 grid cells, each c. 130 km(2)). The spatially explicit plant arbuscular mycorrhizal status distribution model was based on environmental predictors related to climate, geology and land use. The spatial distribution of plant arbuscular mycorrhizal status can be explained as a function of nine environmental predictors (D-2 = 0.54). Proportion of obligate arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species per grid cell increased with increasing temperature range, mean annual temperature, urban area and area of lime as geological parent material and decreased with increasing area of mixed forest and coniferous forest. Annual temperature range was by far the most important predictor. These results extend the comparative context of former studies that established relationships between mycorrhizal status and other plant characteristics at species level, including those describing species ecological requirements, to a context at the level of assemblages and species distributions. We encourage integrating plant mycorrhizal status as a functional trait in future macroecological analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Recently, trait-based approaches have been recognized as an important tool to infer processes governing community assembly patterns. In this study, we quantify patterns of functional composition and diversity to study how tree species coexistence is influenced by abiotic factors and biotic interactions in a species-rich temperate old-growth forest. In a 25 ha (500 x 500 m) fully mapped forest plot, we calculated functional composition (community weighted mean) and diversity of five key traits considering two spatial scales (20 x 20 and 50 x 50 m quadrats). We compared the observed patterns in functional diversity with randomly generated null communities to test for the presence of non-random patterns in community assembly, and studied the variation of functional composition and diversity along gradients of soil conditions to test for the shift in assembly processes along resource gradients. Functional diversity differed from null expectations depending on the spatial scale considered. In broad-scale quadrats (50 x 50 m), functional diversity in wood specific gravity (WSG) and leaf area (LA) was lower than expected by chance, whereas functional diversity in specific root length (SRL) was greater than expected. In small quadrats (20 x 20 m), functional diversity was lower than expected by chance in specific leaf area (SLA) and when considering all traits in combination. Functional composition and diversity varied along the soil resource gradient but the results were dependent on the scale considered. We found an increase in functional composition in maximum height (H) and WSG and a reduction in the functional diversity in most of traits suggesting an increase in competition with the increase in soil water content at small scale. The trait dispersion pattern for all traits in combination had no directional changes with some of individual traits generating more clear dispersion trend when the dominant competitor Pinus koraiensis was removed from the community dataset. The results presented here suggest that community assembly is governed by non-random processes in the studied forests. Interestingly, the choice of quadrat size seems to be crucial to describe community patterns and infer the forces governing community assembly. The consideration of different traits and environmental gradients allowed us to discover that different assembly mechanisms operate simultaneously in the studied forest.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Lin, Fei; Wang, Xugao; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Gazol, Antonio] IPE CSIC, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Ave Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50010, Spain; [Suo, Yanyan; Fang, Shuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mellard, Jarad] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France","Lin, F (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China.",linfei@iae.ac.cn; hzq@iae.ac.cn,"Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; wang, xugao/B-1111-2015","Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; wang, xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852","external cooperation program of BIC, Chinese Academy of Sciences [151221KYSB20130003]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41301057, 31370444]; CFERN & GENE Award Funds on Ecological Paper","We thank Zhao YQ, Xing DL, Song BZ and He XC for collecting species traits data in field.

Serving as one of the major storage systems, optimal operation rules should be proposed promptly for Danjiangkou Reservoir, completed by a heightening project. In this paper, in order to seek out the optimal operation rules for Danjiangkou Reservoir, a multi-objective optimal operation model is developed, considering the inflow uncertainty, multi-year regulation cycle and water supply for the SNWTP. Three evaluation indexes (hydropower generation, water impoundment condition and shortage index) are adopted to assess the impacts of three influence factors (starting regulation level (SRL), inflow condition and flood control level) on Danjiangkou Reservoir operations. Finally, some critical operation strategies for Danjiangkou Reservoir are proposed. The results show that the optimal SRL for Danjiangkou Reservoir is 158 m and the recommended range of the water level at the end of the first year varies between 162-166 m (very wet), 164-166 m (wet), and 162-164 m (normal) on the basis of setting 158 m as the SRL.","[Lian, Jijian; Sun, Xiaozhong; Ma, Chao] Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Ma, C (reprint author), Tianjin Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul Engn Simulat & Safety, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",mac_tju@126.com,,,"Major National Science and Technology Project [2012ZX07205005]; Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51321065]; Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology [13JCZDJC36200, 15JCYBTC21800]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51109156]; Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities [B14012]","This study is supported by the Major National Science and Technology Project (2012ZX07205005), the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51321065), the Tianjin Research Program of Application Foundation and Advanced Technology (13JCZDJC36200, 15JCYBTC21800), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51109156), and the Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (B14012).

Historically, the ecological paradigm has been that species coexist by partitioning resources: as a species increases in abundance, self-limitation kicks in, because species-specific resources decline. However, determining coexistence mechanisms has been a particular puzzle for sedentary organisms with high overlap in their resource requirements, such as plants. Recent evidence suggests that plant-associated microbes could generate the stabilizing self-limitation (negative frequency dependence) that is required for species coexistence. Here, we test the key assumption that plant microbe feedbacks cause such self-limitation. We used competition experiments and modelling to evaluate how two common groups of soil microbes (rhizospheric microbes and biological soil crusts) influenced the self-limitation of two competing desert grass species. Negative feedbacks between the dominant plant competitor and its rhizospheric microbes magnified self-limitation, whereas beneficial interactions between both plant species and biological soil crusts partly counteracted this stabilizing effect. Plant microbe interactions have received relatively little attention as drivers of vegetation dynamics in dry land ecosystems. Our results suggest that microbial mechanisms can contribute to patterns of plant coexistence in arid grasslands.","[Chung, Y.

Its causes and consequences are complex and strongly idiosyncratic. Detailed knowledge of the rate of shrub colonization, and its abiotic and biotic drivers is crucial to fully understand and manage these areas. We used a set of aerial photographs (1956, 1978, 1985, 1998 and 2009) and field data to relate shrub patch dynamics, and abiotic and biotic properties of 27 abandoned steppes in SE Iberian Peninsula. Shrub patch density in 2009 ranged from 11 to 143 patches ha(-1), and increased by an average of similar to 180% between 1956 and 2009. Temporal changes in shrub patch density followed non-linear functions (monomolecular, logistic and exponential) describing early, gradual and late recruitment, respectively. Differences in shrub patch colonization rate were related to the identity of patch-forming species, but contingent on water availability. Total increases in shrub patch density were larger when patches were dominated by late colonizer species. Overall shrub patch dynamics was mostly related to the identity of patch-forming species and climatic conditions, and to a lesser extent physical factors such as aspect and rock cover. Given the sensitivity of patch-forming species to climatic conditions, new challenges for steppe management will emerge over the next decades. Species able to thrive under harsh conditions may increase their dominance at the expense of species adapted to less demanding conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many elements of experimental design can drastically affect the final observed community structure, notably the choice of primers for amplification prior to sequencing. Some targeted microbes can fail to amplify due to primer-targeted sequence divergence and be omitted from obtained sequences, leading to differences among primer pairs in the sequenced organisms even when targeting the same community. This potential source of taxonomic bias in HTS makes it prudent to investigate how primer choice will affect the sequenced community prior to investing in a costly community-wide sequencing effort. Here, we use Fluidigm's microfluidic Access Arrays (IFC) followed by Illumina (R) MiSeq Nano sequencing on a culture-derived local mock community to demonstrate how this approach allows for a low-cost combinatorial investigation of primer pairs and experimental samples (up to 48 primer pairs and 48 samples) to determine the most effective primers that maximize obtained communities whilst minimizing taxonomic biases.","[Brown, Shawn P.; Ferrer, Astrid; Dalling, James W.; Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dalling, James W.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama","Brown, SP (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",spbrown1@illinois.edu,"Brown, Shawn/I-4925-2019","Brown, Shawn/0000-0002-4687-1720",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1241212],"We are greatly appreciative to everyone associated with the implementation and collection of these samples in Panama, particularly Mabelle Chong, Sergio Mosquera and Yaravi Suarez.

Fires can affect physical, chemical and biological soil properties. The effects on soil properties are closely controlled by fire severity, which is a consequence of temperatures reached and the length of residence of heat in the soil. In this study, the response of glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) - a glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi - to heating temperature has been studied. Laboratory heating treatments were carried out at 180 degrees C, 200 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 300 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 500 degrees C in soil samples from eight different sites in SE Spain. The sites selected had mainly different soil characteristics. The results of heating on soil water repellency and soil organic carbon (SOC) were also included in the study. GRSP response to temperature was different between sites. Redundancy analyses divided sandy soils from the rest of soil types. Total content of aggregates, SOC and clay and sand content were the most significant properties explaining the response of GRSP to heating treatments. Results showed that GRSP was affected even at low temperature. SOC response to temperature was very similar between sites. Soil water repellency did not appear after heating in wettable soils and disappeared in water-repellent ones at temperatures over 200 degrees C. Our results indicate that GRSP could provide relevant information about fire severity.

Soil studied, originated from a 1-year-old plantation and a 40-year old stand of Scots pine located in Bierzwnik and Miedzychow forest districts located 200 km apart. The hypothesis assumed that both approaches lead to the discovery of abundant microbiota communities with different structures and with rare common species. The environmental DNA was extracted with a Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit from two soil samples in each site. The ITS1/2 rDNA was amplified with specific primers ITS1 and ewfitsrev 1, and 18S rDNA with universal primers NS1 and NS2. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy. Inserts were primarily selected in blue/white screening on a X-gal medium. Representative clones were further selected in two separate RFLP analyses with HhaI and BsuRI restriction enzymes. Representative clones purified and sequenced using the Sanger Method in the DNA Research Centre (Poznan). Each sequence was identified to the lowest taxonomic rank. Ninety to 233 clones with DNA of 5-44 taxa including 3-37 taxa of fungi were obtained from 4 samples of soil. After application of ITS1/2 rDNA and 18S rDNA, the fungal DNA was detected respectively in 89,60-100,00% and 11,77-64,8% clones and the number of fungal species detected was respectively 12-37 and 3-19. Fungi were represented by four orders: Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Both primers also amplified also DNA of other organisms (mostly from Animalia and Protista Kingdom) represented by 0-9 taxa. If compared, the application of forest soil microbiota structure with ITS1/2 rDNA and 18S rDNA led to detect a lower abundance of fungi and a bigger abundance of other organisms. Considering the higher number of clones and taxa recognized, the region of ITS1/2 rDNA was more effective in the studies of the soil microbiota structure. The region of 18S rDNA was efficient in local detection of Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota and of rare species of fungi from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Despite the deficiency of NCBI database the use of the 18S rDNA region in studies on fungal community the region should be included in molecular studies of fungal diversity. It is concluded that studies on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms need the application of a few independent methods of detection and identification.","[Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta; Kwasna, Hanna] Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy Poznaniu, Katedra Fitopatol Lesnej, Ul Wojska Poiskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland","Behnke-Borowczyk, J (reprint author), Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy Poznaniu, Katedra Fitopatol Lesnej, Ul Wojska Poiskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",jbehnke@up.poznan.pl; kwasna@up.poznan.pl,,,,,,29,0,0,2,14,POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO LESNE,WARSZAWA,"KOMITET REDAKCYJNY SYLWANA, UL BITWY WARSZAWSKIEJ 1920 R NR 3, WARSZAWA, PL-02 362, POLAND",0039-7660,,,SYLWAN,Sylwan,JUL,2016,160,7,,,,,564,572,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,DT9TG,WOS:000381844600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Li, JH; Zhang, J; Li, WJ; Xu, DH; Knops, JMH; Du, GZ",,,,"Li, Jin Hua; Zhang, Ji; Li, Wen Jin; Xu, Dang Hui; Knops, Johannes M.

In contrast to these consistant results in aboveground vegetation parameters, there is no consistant pattern in how N fertilization affects soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Our objectives were to test how plant functional group changes caused by N fertilization affect soil C dynamics and determine if different plant functional groups respond similarly. We conducted a two-factorial experiment to examine soil C dynamics with N fertilization and soil inoculation with field microbial communities in a greenhouse pot experiment. We used six plant species (two grasses and four forbs) that are dominant within sub-alpine meadows on the east part of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. For both grasses and forbs, N fertilization and soil inoculation, alone or in combination, decreased SOC by 4-10% and increased soil microbial biomass. For grasses, N fertilization combined with inoculation caused much lower SOC content and higher soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) as compared to inoculation alone. In contrast to forbs, grass aboveground biomass was significantly negatively correlated with SOC change and positively correlated with MBC change. Nitrogen fertilization combined with inoculation significantly increased basal respiration and cumulative C mineralization rates for both grasses and three of the four forbs as compared to inoculation alone. Grasses had higher basal respiration rates than forbs under these two treatments. Despite higher aboveground grass biomass, N-fertilization lowered the SOC pool by increasing soil MBC and basal respiration rates, thus increasing C decomposition. Overall, in these sub-alpine meadows, grasses and forbs impact on soil C dynamics differs and grasses, but not forbs, may reduce soil C sequestration in response to N fertilization.

In this study, we evaluated the role that host and symbiont phylogeny might play in determining patterns of mutualistic benefit for interactions among nine species of Acacia and 31 strains of nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria. Using phylogenetic comparative methods we compared patterns of variation in mutualistic benefit (host response to inoculation) to rhizobial phylogenies constructed from housekeeping and symbiosis genes; and a multigene host phylogeny. We found widespread genotype-by-genotype variation in patterns of plant growth. A relatively large component of this variation (21-28%) was strongly influenced by the interacting evolutionary histories of both partners, such that phylogenetically similar host species had similar growth responses when inoculated with phylogenetically similar rhizobia. We also found a relatively large nonphylogenetic effect for the average mutualistic benefit provided by rhizobia to plants, such that phylogenetic relatedness did not predict the overall benefit provided by rhizobia across all hosts. We conclude that phylogenetic relatedness should frequently predict patterns of mutualistic benefit in acacia-rhizobial mutualistic interactions; but that some mutualistic traits also evolve independently of the phylogenies.","[Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Agr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Zee, Peter C.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Miller, Joseph T.] CSIRO Natl Facil & Collect, Natl Res Collect Australia, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Miller, Joseph T.] Natl Sci Fdn, Div Environm Biol, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA","Barrett, LG (reprint author), CSIRO Agr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",luke.barrett@csiro.au,"Barrett, Luke/I-5711-2015; Miller, Joseph T./M-2693-2016","Barrett, Luke/0000-0001-6530-0731; Miller, Joseph T./0000-0002-5788-9010",NSW Environmental Trust; National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; NSF-Systematic Biology grant [DEB 04-14902],"We thank C.

The density of fine-root systems produced by the forb and the grass in pots were 6.8 cm cm(-3) soil and 48.1 cm cm(-3) soil, respectively. Seedlings survival of the heliophilous herbaceous, early-and late-successional woody species were 86%, 70% and 100% in presence of the forb root system and 12%, 14% and 100% in competition with grass root system, respectively. The competitive pressure applied by the grass root system on seedling growth of the heliophilous herbaceous, early-and late-successional woody species were 2.4, 1.9 and 1.4 times greater than the forb root system. Total root length of the heliophilous herbaceous, early-and late-successional woody species grown without competitors were 13, 33 and 5 times greater than in competition with forb, and were 66, 54 and 6 times greater than in competition with grass root system, respectively. The averages of fine-root diameter of plants grown without competitors were 209 mu m for the heliophilous herbaceous, 281 mu m for early-successional trees and 382 mu m for late-successional trees. The root system of the forb did not avoid seedling establishment of most plant species, but the grass root system hampered more the establishment of heliophilous herbaceous and early-successional woody species than the seedling establishment of late-successional woody species. The different density of root systems produced in soil by the forb and the grass, and the distinct root traits (e.g. root diameter and root tissue density) of the early-and late-successional plant species can explain the differences in the establishment of seedlings of plant species belonging to different groups of tropical succession when exposed to below-ground competition.","[Zangaro, Waldemar; Matsuura, Enio Massao; Lirio Rondina, Artur Berbel] Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Azevedo Marques Lescano, Luis Eduardo] Univ Estadual Norte Parana, Campus Luiz Meneghel, BR-86360000 Bandeirantes, PR, Brazil; [Nogueira, Marco Antonio] Embrapa Soja, POB 231, BR-86001970 Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Zangaro, Waldemar; Matsuura, Enio Massao; Lirio Rondina, Artur Berbel] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Londrina, PR, Brazil; [Nogueira, Marco Antonio] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Microbiol, Programa Posgrad Microbiol, Londrina, PR, Brazil","Zangaro, W (reprint author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Anim & Vegetal, BR-86051990 Londrina, PR, Brazil.",wzangaro@uel.br,"Zangaro, Waldemar/A-2890-2008",,CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); CAPESCAPES,The authors would like to thank CNPq and CAPES for financial support.

Moreover, it is also essential to explore phylogenetic and functional mechanisms driving these interactions. In a greenhouse experiment, we selected nine groups of alien and native plant species from the herbaceous flora of Germany to disentangle their direct and indirect interactions. Each group had an alien (A) that is common or rare in Germany (i.e. non-native range), two natives that are phylogenetically closely related (N-close) and distantly related (N-dist) to A respectively, and a distantly related target native (T). We grew the four species of each group alone, and in two-species and three-species combinations. Specifically, we tested whether competition is greater between A and N-close than between A and N-dist, whether presence of N-close rather than N-dist indirectly alleviates competition of A on T, and whether these interaction patterns depend on commonness of A. Moreover, we tested how intensity of these interactions is explained by phylogenetic distance, functional traits (height, seed mass, SLA, leaf size, specific root length, leaf area ratio, root length ratio (root length/plant mass), shoot weight ratio) and traits-based functional distance. We found A had stronger competition on N-close than on N-dist. In turn, A was more suppressed by N-close than by N-dist, but this was only true for rare rather than common A. The presence of N-dist rather than N-close indirectly reduced competition of A on T. The intensity of these interactions was not explained by phylogenetic or functional distance, but by some of the functional traits. Specifically, a plant experienced stronger competition when it was shorter and had smaller leaves and lower shoot weight ratio, and when its neighbours were taller, had greater SLA, leaf area ratio and shoot weight ratio, and had a lower root length ratio.Synthesis. Functional traits can help explain competitive interactions. While direct competition tended to be stronger between more closely related alien and native plants, this did not indirectly facilitate other co-occurring native plants.","[Feng, Yanhao; van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany","Feng, YH (reprint author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Univ Str 10, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",yanhao.feng@uni-konstanz.de,,,China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council,"We thank Otmar Ficht, Charlotte Becker, Heike Kropp, Carola Dostal, Anja Meents, Anna Gorenflo, Dominika Kundel, Carolin Bogs and Linda Lorcher for practical assistance, and Ayub Oduor, Wayne Dawson, Marcel Dorken, Judy Simon, Mialy Razanajatovo, Yanjie Liu, Yan Li and Lei Ning for their valuable comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

While evidence suggests that pollinator mutualisms may decline near range boundaries, little is known about other important plant mutualisms, including microbial root symbionts. Here, we used molecular methods to characterize root-associated fungal communities in populations of two related temperate tree species from across the species' range in the eastern United States. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal richness on plant roots declined with distance from the centre of the host species range. These patterns were not evident in nonmycorrhizal fungal communities on roots nor in fungal communities in bulk soil. Climatic and soil chemical variables could not explain these biogeographic patterns, although these abiotic gradients affected other components of the bulk soil and rhizosphere fungal community. Depauperate ectomycorrhizal fungal communities may represent an underappreciated challenge to marginal tree populations, especially as rapid climate change pushes these populations outside their current climate niche.","[Lankau, Richard A.; Keymer, Daniel P.] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30606 USA; [Lankau, Richard A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Keymer, Daniel P.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA","Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30606 USA.; Lankau, RA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Plant Pathol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",lankau@wisc.edu,"Lankau, Richard/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard/0000-0001-9995-328X",NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1045977],"We thank Rachel Nodurft, Ryan Baskin and Shana Pau for assistance with field collections and laboratory procedures.

Variation in seed attributes can determine a species' potential to adapt to new climates. This study aimed to investigate the germination behavior of Lytocaryum weddellianum along climatic gradients at two altitudes in the Serra dos A""rgos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We conducted ex situ experiments on germination under two light conditions (light or dark) and three levels of water potential (I = 0, -0.4 or -0.8 MPa) over 8 months. In addition, seeds of different sizes were sown and after 6 months seedlings were divided into shoot and root components. The following growth parameters were measured: root, shoot and total biomass, leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio. Our results showed that the high- and low-altitude populations had different germination rates, seed mass, and resource allocation in seedlings. The lower altitude population, with higher temperatures and humidity, higher germination rates, produced heavier seeds, and their seedlings invested more in root and total biomass. Meanwhile, seedlings from the higher altitude site, with less available light, had a greater investment in foliar parameters. These differences in the two populations' seedling establishment strategies over an altitudinal gradient in the Serra dos A""rgos suggest that the species may have the potential to adapt to predicted climate change in this region.","[Macedo Oda, Gabriela Akemi] Bot Garden Rio de Janeiro JBRJ, Natl Sch Trop Biol, Rua Pacheco Leao 2014, BR-22460036 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Guedes Braz, Maria Isabel; Quitete Portela, Rita de Cassia] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Macedo Oda, Gabriela Akemi] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Inst Forests, Dept Environm Sci, BR465,Km7, BR-23897970 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil","Oda, GAM (reprint author), Bot Garden Rio de Janeiro JBRJ, Natl Sch Trop Biol, Rua Pacheco Leao 2014, BR-22460036 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Oda, GAM (reprint author), Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Inst Forests, Dept Environm Sci, BR465,Km7, BR-23897970 Seropedica, RJ, Brazil.",gbakemi@uol.com.br,,,PAPD fellowship; FAPERJCarlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ); CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"We are Grateful to Nicolas and Raquel Locke and INEA for permission to work in protected areas.

This paper measures the wood production, root and leaf area (and mass) in a chronosequence of fire-origin lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Loudon) stands consisting of four age classes (12, 21, 53, and a parts per thousand yen100 years), each replicated similar to five times. Wood productivity was greatest in the 53-year-old stands and then declined in the a parts per thousand yen100-year-old stands. Growth efficiency, the quantity of wood produced per unit leaf mass, steadily declined with age. Leaf mass and fine root mass plateaued between the 53- and a parts per thousand yen100-year-old stands, but leaf area index actually increased in the older stands. An increase in the leaf area index:fine root area ratio supports the idea that older stand are potentially limited by soil resources. Other factors contributing to slower growth in older stands might be lower soil temperatures and increased self-shading due to the clumped nature of crowns. Collectively, the proportionally greater reduction in fine roots in older stands might be the variable that predisposes these forests to be at a potentially greater risk of stress-induced mortality.","[Schoonmaker, A.

Materials and methods A mutant strain of R. tropici impaired in the synthesis of homospermidine has been constructed (Rt hss::Omega, Sp(r)) and the response to salinity of the free-living and symbiotic bacteria has been analyzed. Plants of P. vulgaris inoculated with the mutant strain were treated with 100 mM NaCl, and the concentration of polyamines was determined in different nodular fractions together with nitrogen fixation and gene expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes. Results Neither homospermidine nor 4-aminobutilcadaverine was detected in the free-living mutant bacteria and in nodules of plants inoculated with Rt hss::Omega, Sp(r). This strain was more sensitive to salinity than the wild type, and plants inoculated with the mutant bacteria had lower nodule fresh weight than with the wild type. Conclusion Homospermidine synthase contributes to salt stress in both free-living and symbiotic bacteria. Despite the synthesis of homospermidine, this enzyme produces also 4-aminobutilcadaverine. Based on the lower nodule fresh weight and plant biomass reduction induced by salinity in plants inoculated with the mutant strain, this enzyme seems to be involved in nodule organogenesis and salt tolerance.","[Lopez-Gomez, Miguel; Cobos-Porras, Libertad; Lluch, Carmen] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fisiol Vegetal, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Prell, Juergen] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Soil Ecol, Worringer Weg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Lopez-Gomez, M (reprint author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Fisiol Vegetal, Campus Fuentenueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",mlgomez@ugr.es,"Lopez-Gomez, Miguel/K-7300-2017","Lopez-Gomez, Miguel/0000-0001-9775-5896","Andalusian Research Program [AGR-139]; Spanish Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN) [AGL2009-09223]; University of Granada (Estancias Breves)","This work has been supported by the Andalusian Research Program (AGR-139), the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (Grant: AGL2009-09223), and the research program of the University of Granada (Estancias Breves 2014).",,37,5,5,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUL,2016,404,2-Jan,,,,,413,425,,10.1007/s11104-016-2848-7,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,DP5RY,WOS:000378556400029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bernal, B; McKinley, DC; Hungate, BA; White, PM; Mozdzer, TJ; Megonigal, JP",,,,"Bernal, Blanca; McKinley, Duncan C.; Hungate, Bruce A.; White, Paul M.; Mozdzer, Thomas J.; Megonigal, J.

We examined the C dynamics in three soil horizons and their responses to changes in substrate availability in a coarse textured sandy spodosol (0.0-0.1, 1.0-13, and 2.7-3.0 m deep). Substrate additions were intended to mimic an increase in root exudates and available inorganic nitrogen (N) that would follow an increase of belowground biomass at depth, as previously found in a long-term CO2 enrichment experiment at this site. We incubated these soils for 60 days with glucose, alanine, and leaf litter, crossed with an inorganic N amendment equivalent to three times ambient concentrations. The organic substrates were isotopically labeled (C-13), allowing us to determine the source of mineralized C and assess the priming effect. Enzyme activity increased as much as 13 times in the two deeper horizons (1.0-1.3, and 2.7-3.0 m) after the addition of the organic substrates, even though the deepest horizon had microbial biomass and microbial phospholipid fatty acids below the level of detection before the experiment. The deepest horizon (2.7-3.0 m) yielded the largest priming response under alanine, indicating that microorganisms in these soil horizons can become active in response to input of organic substrates. Inorganic N amendments significantly decreased the priming effect, suggesting that decomposition may not be N limited. However, alanine (organic N) yielded the highest priming effect at every soil depth, indicating the importance of differentiating effect of organic and inorganic N on decomposition. Distinct priming effects with depth suggest that portions of the soil profile can respond differently to organic inputs. Our findings indicate that the deep soil C pools might be more vulnerable to environmental or anthropogenic change than previously thought, potentially influencing net CO2 exchange estimates between the land and the atmosphere.

Ten isolates representing different 16S rRNA-RFLP types were selected for further sequence analyses of 16S rRNA and four housekeeping genes. As results, nine genospecies belonging to the genera Ensifer, Neorhizobium, Agrobacterium, Pararhizobium, and Rhizobium could be defined among the isolates. The nodC and nifH phylogenies of 14 isolates representing different symbiotic-RFLP types revealed five lineages linked to Ensifer fredii, Ensifer meliloti, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Mesorhizobium amorphae, and Rhizobium gallicum, which demonstrated the various origins and lateral transfers of symbiotic genes between different genera and species. The rhizobial diversities of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus varied among regions, and the community compositions of rhizobia associated with A. mongolicus were significantly different in wild and cultured fields. Constrained correspondence analysis showed that the distribution of A. mongolicus rhizobia could be explained by available potassium content and that the assembly of symbiotic types was mainly affected by available phosphorus content and carbon-nitrogen ratio.","[Zhao, Liang; Wang, Xinye; Huo, Haibo; Yuan, Guijie; Sun, Yali; Zhang, Dehui; Cao, Ying; Xu, Lin; Wei, Gehong] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wei, GH (reprint author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",weigehong@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31125007],We thank Zhengshan Liu and Peng Zhao for helping in nodule collection.

We set up a laboratory experiment to quantify and disentangle the effect of Alnus incana roots on soil permeability and aggregate stability. Plants were grown in pots in a climate chamber for four different growing periods (1, 2, 4 and 8 months). Pots were filled with a soil coming from a moraine of a landslide area in Central Switzerland. After each growing period, surface permeability, soil volume permeability and soil aggregate stability were measured together with the development of the root systems. Our results show that alder roots significantly improve both surface and whole soil volume permeability already after 2 months of growth. Nevertheless, an increase in root length density does not necessarily correspond to an increase in permeability. We could set as a threshold a root length density of 0.1 cm/cm(3) until which an increase in root development corresponds to an increase in soil permeability, whereas after this threshold we observed a decrease in soil permeability. A significant increase in soil aggregate stability could be observed only with a root length density of 2 cm/cm(3). No obvious correlation between soil permeability and aggregate stability could be found. Future work should validate these laboratory results with field data.

This model estimated N transfer among the examined taxa by measuring changes in the stable isotope ratio of N (delta N-15). Although N content in tephra was low at both sites, it was higher on the ridge than on the hillslope, and higher in the willow patch than on bare ground or in the larch understory. The non-mycorrhizal sedge (Carex oxyandra) exhibited non-significant differences between the two sites regarding delta N-15 for N obtained from tephra. Larches developed a relationship with larch-specific Suillus mycorrhizal fungal species in the roots, and had a lower foliar delta N-15 on the hillslope than on the ridge. The larch delta N-15 increased during the growing season, while the willow delta N-15 remained stable. The dependence of larch on mycorrhizal fungi for N uptake was 3-5 % on the ridge and 56-76 % on the hillslope in autumn. Therefore, larches exhibited a flexible symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for obtaining N. Over 45 % of the N taken up by willow plants was obtained from mycorrhizal fungi at both sites. In conclusion, willow plants promoted N deposition in tephra through the litter supply, and formed a stable relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. This enabled successful revegetation with larch plants, which exhibited flexibility in terms of N uptake (i.e., dependent on mycorrhizae or from tephra).","[Kwon, TaeOh; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Kwon, T (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",elixirtok@gmail.com,"Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/F-9090-2012","Tsuyuzaki, Shiro/0000-0003-3010-8699",,,,47,0,1,1,23,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Determining the cause and effect of plant phenotypes is central for understanding these eco-evolutionary dynamics since phenotypes respond to soil selective gradients that are, in turn, modified by plant traits. Genetic variation in plant phenotypes can change soil processes and biotic communities; oppositely, soil gradients and microbial communities can influence the expression and evolution of plant phenotypes. Although these processes represent the two halves of genetic based PSF, research in these areas has developed independently from one another. Greater connectivity between research on ecosystem consequences of plant genetic variation and soil selective gradients that drive plant phenotypic evolution will create novel and important opportunities to link ecology and evolution in natural systems. Papers in this special feature build on the inherent ecological and evolutionary processes involved in PSF, outlining many ways to identify and test mechanisms that connect ecosystem ecology and evolution.","[Van Nuland, Michael E.; Wooliver, Rachel C.; Pfennigwerth, Alix A.; Read, Quentin D.; Ware, Ian M.; Mueller, Liam; Fordyce, James A.; Schweitzer, Jennifer A.; Bailey, Joseph K.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Van Nuland, ME (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",mvannula@vols.utk.edu,,"Fordyce, James/0000-0002-2731-0418; Wooliver, Rachel/0000-0002-7723-437X; Pfennigwerth, Alix/0000-0001-5102-7324",National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0929298]; University of Tennessee,This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-0929298.

Evolution is most likely to affect ecological patterns when selection pressure is particularly strong, or when the generation time of at least one interacting species is relatively short. Interactions between plants and soil microbes are an excellent candidate for examining eco-evo interactions because interactions between organisms are tightly knit with the potential for species with relatively short generation times to impose strong selection on one another. Here, we examine the potential for eco-evolutionary dynamics in plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). Genetic variation in plant traits and subsequent evolution of those traits can affect traits and species composition of soil microbial communities. Soil microbial communities can, in turn, alter the evolutionary trajectory of plant traits. Further, the direction and magnitude of PSFs can affect the plant community, which may alter the selection on plant traits via intra- and interspecific interactions. Finally, we consider how eco-evolutionary feedbacks might enhance or mitigate the effects of PSFs in driving the structure of natural plant communities.","[terHorst, Casey P.; Zee, Peter C.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA","terHorst, CP (reprint author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, 18111 Nordhoff St, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",casey.terhorst@csun.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-132490],"We thank two anonymous reviewers, Joe Bailey, Po-Ju Ke, Jay Lennon, and Tomomi Suwa for providing comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

Pathogenic soil-borne fungi are often responsible for JC effects. However, previous ecological studies have not placed JC effects in the context of beneficial soil bacteria. Using the JC effect surrounding a subtropical legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) as a model, we characterized tripartite interactions between seedlings, soil fungi and plant-associated bacteria. Survival of seedlings grown in soil inocula collected at close distances to focal adult trees was reduced. Half of the experimental units were treated with fungicides to confirm the presence of pathogenic fungi. In a parallel experiment, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia induced fewer nodules on O.glaberrima seedlings when soil inocula were collected closer to focal adult trees. An inoculation experiment with rhizobial isolates promoted nodulation of seedlings grown in soil taken at close distances to adult trees, suggesting that rhizobial densities are suboptimal at these locations.Fusarium oxysporum, a pathogen of O.glaberrima seedlings, produced exudates that inhibited growth of most bacteria isolated from nodules. Accordingly, F.oxysporum negatively affected rhizosphere colonization of rhizobia in a co-inoculation experiment. Contrariwise, certain Burkholderia isolates (from nodules and the rhizosphere) were identified that possess the ability to inhibit growth of F.oxysporum. The majority of the antagonistic bacteria were isolated from locations with fungal pathogens, suggesting competition between fungi and rhizosphere bacteria. Exclusion of pathogenic fungi by application of fungicides promoted nodulation of O.glaberrima seedlings under growth-room and field conditions.Synthesis. Our findings indicate that soil-borne pathogens surrounding adult trees are microbial keystone species that locally influence interactions between seedlings and plant-associated bacteria.","[Liu, Lan; Yu, Shixiao; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Staehelin, Christian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lan; Xie, Zhi-Ping; Staehelin, Christian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Key Lab Plant Resources, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Zhi-Ping; Staehelin, Christian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Shenzhen Res & Dev Ctr, Baoan Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China","Xie, ZP; Staehelin, C (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Xie, ZP; Staehelin, C (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Key Lab Plant Resources, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Xie, ZP; Staehelin, C (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Shenzhen Res & Dev Ctr, Baoan Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China.",xiezping@mail.sysu.edu.cn; cst@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Yu, Shixiao/0000-0003-1943-0185","Science Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology [2016K0011]; Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province [2013B020302002, 2013B051000043]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31361140363]","We thank Yongfan Wang, Weinan Ye, Caifeng Ma, Xinhua Sui, Xu Meng, Zhiming Zhang, Minghua Zhang, Jiangfeng Li, Juan Bai, Christian Wagner and Fangliang He for their help and advice with various aspects of this work.

Recent studies have revealed that structures of those below-ground plant-fungus networks differ between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Nonetheless, we still remain ignorant of how ericaceous plant species, which dominate arctic and alpine tundra, constitute networks with their root-associated fungi. Based on a high-throughput DNA sequencing data set, we characterized the statistical properties of a network involving 16 ericaceous plant species and more than 500 fungal taxa in the alpine-subalpine region of Mt. Tateyama, central Japan. While all the 16 ericaceous species were associated mainly with fungi in the order Helotiales, they varied remarkably in association with fungi in other orders such as Sebacinales, Atheliales, Agaricales, Russulales and Thelephorales. The ericaceous plant-fungus network was characterized by high symbiont/host preferences. Moreover, the network had a characteristic structure called 'anti-nestedness', which has been previously reported in ectomycorrhizal plant-fungus networks. The results lead to the hypothesis that ericaceous plants in harsh environments can host unexpectedly diverse root-associated fungal taxa, constituting networks whose structures are similar to those of previously reported ectomycorrhizal networks but not to those of arbuscular mycorrhizal ones.","[Toju, H.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Tanabe, A.

Phylogenetic analysis of the genes responsible for their symbiotic abilities (i.e., those encoded on the nodulation [nod] and nitrogen-fixation [nif] loci) has facilitated the development of an extensive phylogeographic framework for the genus. This framework however contains only a few nodulating isolates from Africa. Here we focused on nodulating Bradyrhizobium isolates associated with native southern African legumes in the tribes Genisteae and Crotalarieae found along the Great Escarpment in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. The aims of this study were to: (1) obtain rhizobial isolates from legumes in the Genisteae and Crotalarieae; (2) verify their nodulation ability; (3) characterize them to species level based on phylogenetic analyses of several protein coding gene regions (atpD, dnaK, gin! I, recA, rpoB and gyrB) and (4) determine their placement in the phylogeographic framework inferred from the sequences of the symbiotic loci nodA and nifD. Twenty of the 21 Bradyrhizobium isolates belonged to six novel species, while one was conspecific with the recently described B. arachidis. Among these isolates, the nodA phylogeny revealed several new clades, with 18 of our isolates found in Clades XIV and XV, and only three forming part of the cosmopolitan Clade III. These strains formed predominantly the same groups in the nifD phylogeny although with slight differences; indicating that both vertical and horizontal inheritance of the symbiotic loci occurred. These findings suggest that the largely unexplored diversity of indigenous African rhizobia are characterized by unique ancestries that might mirror the distribution of their hosts and the environmental factors driving their evolution.

Methods AMF community in populus roots was deciphered with 454-pyrosequencing method from a field plot before and after 15 days waterlogging. Results We found that short-term waterlogging significantly altered the AMF community as confirmed with NMDS. Indicator species analysis identified 12 AMF OTUs that shown with different relative abundance between before and after waterlogging. In contrast to expectation, short-term waterlogging increased detectable AMF species richness: 4 OTUs were detected only before and 17 only after waterlogging. Conclusions Variation in abundance of dominant OTUs was possibly due to short-term waterlogging disturbance and the role of competitive release in the increase in species richness following waterlogging.","[Yang, Haishui; Zhang, Qian] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry, 1 Dongxiaofu,Xiangshan Rd, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haishui] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Minist Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol Ecol & Prod Management, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Koide, Roger T.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Zhang, Qian] State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Tree Breeding & Cultivat, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China","Zhang, Q (reprint author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry, 1 Dongxiaofu,Xiangshan Rd, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",east.qzhang@gmail.com,"Koide, Roger T/I-4033-2012; Koide, Roger/C-6354-2014","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31300105, 41071334, 31400373]; Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [RIF2012-08, CAFYBB2014QB003]; PAPD Fund of Nanjing Agricultural University [80900314]","We are grateful to Maarja Opik (University of Tartu) and Stefano Ghignone (National Research Council, Italy) for providing QIIME formatted MaarjAM database.

The root-living diversity is largely unknown which is unsatisfactory as 68% of the wood harvested at stump extraction is root wood. We compared the diversity of saproxylic beetles in Norway spruce, Picea abies, coarse roots with that in the above-ground part of the same stumps. Five below-ground (root) and eight above-ground (stump) samples were collected from early-decay stumps at each of twelve Swedish clear-cuts. In total 8314 saproxylic beetles of 60 species were reared from the 156 wood samples. The estimated species richness in roots (47 species) was 51% of that in stumps (93). When root and stump samples were pooled the total estimate was 116 species. The phylogenetic diversity (average taxonomic distinctness) in individual roots was only 63% of that in stumps. Species composition differed between substrate types, and only 28% of the species were common to both substrates. Most root samples were numerically dominated by Dryocoetes autographus (33% of the samples) or Hylobius abietis (10%). Most stump samples were dominated by Crypturgus spp. (66%) or Rhagium inquisitor (19%). Of the 17 most abundant species, five were associated with roots and two of those used roots exclusively. Ten species were associated with stumps. We conclude that the root living beetles constitute an important part of the stump/root assemblage and should not be overlooked when the effects of stump harvest on biodiversity is evaluated.

Mycorrhizal fungi, with their vast filamentous networks in symbiosis with the roots of most plants can alter a-large number of minerals via local acidification, targeted excretion of ligands, submicron-scale biomechanical forcing, and mobilization of Mg, Fe, Al, and K at the hypha-biotite interface. Here, we present experimental evidence that Paxillus involutus-a basidiomycete fungus in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), is able to oxidize a substantial amount of structural Fe(II) in biotite. Iron redox chemistry, quantified by X-ray absorption near edge spectra on 13 fungi biotite sections along three distinct hypha colonizing the [001] basal plane of biotite, revealed variable but extensive Fe(II) oxidation up to similar to 2 mu m in depth and a Fe(III)/Fe-total ratio of up to similar to 0.8. The growth of Fe(III) hydroxide implies a volumetric change and a strain within the biotite lattice potentially large enough to induce microcrack formation, which are abundant below the hypha biotite interface. This. Fe(II) oxidation also leads to the formation of a large pool of Fe(III) (i.e., structural Fe(III) and Fe(III) oxyhydroxides) within biotite that could participate in the Fe redox cycling in soils.","[Bonneville, Steeve] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Geosci Environm & Soc, Biogeochim & Modelisat Syst Terre, 50 Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Bray, Andrew W.; Benning, Liane G.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Cohen Geochem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Benning, Liane G.] German Res Ctr Geosci, GFZ, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany","Bonneville, S (reprint author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Geosci Environm & Soc, Biogeochim & Modelisat Syst Terre, 50 Av FD Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",steeve.bonneville@ulb.ac.be,"Benning, Liane/E-7071-2011","Benning, Liane/0000-0001-9972-5578; Bray, Andy/0000-0001-5399-6647","Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; UK Natural Environment Research Council ""Weathering Science Consortium"" [NE/C004566/1, NE/J022365/1]; ""Victor Brien"", ""Van Buren"" funds; Fonds National de la Recherche ScientifiqueFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [FNRS-PDR T.1012.14]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/C004566/1, NE/J022365/1]","D.

This study involved assessing changes in soil phosphorus (P) over a 10 year period following the afforestation of grazed pasture with 3 contrasting tree species (Pinus radiata, Cupressus macrocarpa, Eucalyptus nitens) in a replicated field trial at Orton Bradley Park, New Zealand. A combination of techniques (sequential fractionation, alkaline phosphatase hydrolysable P, solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) was used to quantify changes in the nature and bioavailability of soil P. Results revealed that the establishment and growth of trees caused a significant decrease in soil organic P within 10 years, indicating net organic P mineralisation. Surprisingly this trend was similar under all three tree species, which suggested similar soil P acquisition despite differences in the type of mycorrhizae associated with each species: P. radiata is ectomycorrhizal, C. macrocarpa is arbuscular mycorrhizal, and E. nitens can beectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal. The observed changes in soil P dynamics were attributed a combination of tree growth and P uptake irrespective of species and changes in P inputs and organic P turnover associated with the cessation of grazing following tree planting. Changes in the nature of organic P determined 10 years after establishment indicated that organic matter inputs associated with tree growth were having an increasing influence on soil P dynamics with time.","[Chirino-Valle, I.; Condron, L.

We assessed the seasonal dynamics of endorhizal fungal symbioses in four dominant tree species (Alnus nepalensis, Castanopsis hystrix, Emblica officinalis, Schima wallichii) in two plantation forest stands of Northeastern India, a biodiversity hotspot part of the Indo-Burma region. All tree species examined had a dual association of AM and DSE fungi and such fungal symbioses are reported for the first time in A. nepalensis, C. hystrix and S. wallichii. Intermediate-type AM morphology was common in three tree species, while Paris-type AM morphology was found in S. wallichii. Colonization of AM and DSE fungi varied significantly across tree species and seasons. A total of 18 AM fungal spore morphotypes were isolated from the air-dried natural rhizosphere soils and trap culture experiments. Spore density of AM fungi was highest in summer, whereas AM colonization in roots was highest during the rainy season. In contrast, root colonization with DSE fungi was highest during summer, except for E. officinalis. A significant negative correlation occurred between certain AM fungal and soil variables. In contrast, DSE fungal measures were not correlated to any of the soil properties examined. Correlation analysis indicated a certain degree of competition between AM and DSE fungi. Occurrence of AM and DSE fungal associations in economically important indigenous tree species indicates the possibility of utilizing them in future conservation programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

In some orchids, a disproportionate increase in nuclear DNA contents has been observed, where successive endoreduplication cycles result in DNA amounts 2C + P, 2C+ 3P, 2C+ 7P, etc., where P is the DNA content of the replicated part of the 2C nuclear genome. This unique phenomenon was termed ""progressively partial endoreplication"" ( PPE). We investigated processes behind the PPE in Ludisia discolor using flow cytometry ( FCM) and Illumina sequencing. In particular, we wanted to determine whether chromatin elimination or incomplete genome duplication was involved, and to identify types of DNA sequences that were affected. Cell cycle analysis of root tip cell nuclei pulse-labeled with EdU revealed two cell cycles, one ending above the population of nuclei with 2C+ P content, and the other witha typical"" horseshoe"" pattern of S-phase nuclei ranging from 2C to 4C DNA contents. The process leading to nuclei with 2C+ P amounts therefore involves incomplete genome replication. Subsequent Illumina sequencing of flow-sorted 2C and 2C+ P nuclei showed that all types of repetitive DNA sequences were affected during PPE; a complete elimination of any specific type of repetitive DNA was not observed. We hypothesize that PPE is part of a highly controlled transition mechanism from proliferation phase to differentiation phase of plant tissue development.","[Hribova, Eva; Holusova, Katerina; Petrovska, Beata; Simkova, Hana; Dolezel, Jaroslav; Vrana, Jan] Inst Expt Bot, Ctr Reg Hana Biotechnol & Agr Res, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Travnicek, Pavel; Suda, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Travnicek, Pavel; Suda, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Prague, Czech Republic; [Travnicek, Pavel; Kubatova, Barbora; Curn, Vladislav] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Agr, Ctr Biotechnol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Ponert, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Expt Plant Biol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Ponert, Jan] Prague Bot Garden, Prague, Czech Republic; [Jersakova, Jana] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Vrana, J (reprint author), Inst Expt Bot, Ctr Reg Hana Biotechnol & Agr Res, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",vrana@ueb.cas.cz,"Kubatova, Barbora/D-6249-2016; Travnicek, Pavel/G-9028-2012; Vrana, Jan/F-7306-2014; Holusova, Katerina/S-7244-2018; Petrovska, Beata/F-6106-2014; Dolezel, Jaroslav/B-7716-2008; Curn, Vladislav/A-9692-2018; Ponert, Jan/S-2083-2017","Kubatova, Barbora/0000-0001-9461-7578; Travnicek, Pavel/0000-0002-5806-1645; Vrana, Jan/0000-0001-6171-8516; Holusova, Katerina/0000-0002-4531-7170; Petrovska, Beata/0000-0002-0315-9872; Dolezel, Jaroslav/0000-0002-6263-0492; Curn, Vladislav/0000-0002-9661-8715; Ponert, Jan/0000-0003-3827-8086",,,,55,7,7,3,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1759-6653,,,GENOME BIOL EVOL,Genome Biol.

This study examined the effects of CC and SB on soil CO2 efflux components in a Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook (Chinese fir, CF) plantation and a secondary evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) located in Fujian Province, southeastern China. Aboveground litter removal and root trenching were used to estimate CO2 fluxes from soil organic matter decomposition (R-SOM), litter decomposition (R-L), and autotrophic respiration by roots and mycorrhizae (R-R). These components were measured 5-7 times per month from 18 October 2001 to 25 December 2003 using soda lime absorption. We found that R-R, R-L and R-SOM were initially higher in CC and SB plots than controls in both forests, but these three component fluxes in disturbed plots all fell below those of the control 5-20 months after the disturbance. Also, Q(10) values of these components decreased following disturbance. The annual flux of each respiration component was greater under BF than CF. The contribution of R-R to soil CO2 efflux in the control plots averaged 35% in CF and 46% in BF. R-SOM was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in CC and SB plots, accounting for over 50%. Our results highlight the importance of temporal trends of the component fluxes following disturbance and contribute to a broader understanding of forest management effects on the soil C cycle.","[Guo, J.

Investigating the mechanisms responsible for species coexistence in urban ecosystems is important to prevent forest invasions and conserve native biodiversity. In this experiment, we studied seedling recruitment for two exotic invasive (Acer platanoides and Rhamnus cathartica) and two native tree species (Acer saccharum and Betula papyrifera) in two urban forests. We measured the effects of distance from a mature tree on the growth of conspecific seedlings and their belowground interactions (mutualisms and pathogens). We expected that native seedlings growing in close proximity to a mature conspecific tree would more likely be damaged by co-specific pathogens than those growing further away. In contrast, considering that exotic invaders have not coevolved with the local soil pathogens, distance from the adult conspecific tree would not affect their seedlings. We collected undisturbed soil cores at five incremental distances from each adult tree and grew conspecific seeds in these cores. After three months of growth, we measured plant biomass, mycorrhizal root colonization and root lesions. We found that biomass increased with distance from the mature conspecific tree only for A. platanoides and no distance dependent signal was detected for other response variables. Our results show that distance from a conspecific mature tree may not determine exotic species invasibility in an urban forest and that, instead, this may contribute to promote native and invasive species coexistence in urban forest systems.","[Martinez-Garcia, L.

This structure enables the plant to resprout prolifically after severe disturbances that remove the aboveground biomass. These are considered adaptive traits in ecosystems with highly frequent and severe disturbances-such as fire-prone ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the knowledge of lignotubers in the Mediterranean basin and highlight the evolutionary implications. We first summarise existing knowledge on lignotuber species in the Mediterranean basin. We then provide a detailed morpho-anatomical description of early lignotubers in two common woody species (Arbutus unedo L. and Phillyrea angustifolia L.). Finally, we compare our anatomical results with those obtained in studies conducted with other lignotuberous species from different Mediterranean regions. Lignotubers were verified in 14 species in the Mediterranean basin; all being from lineages with origins dating to the Tertiary and thus pre-dating the Mediterranean climate. In A. unedo and P. angustifolia, lignotubers are macroscopically discernible in 4- and 2-year-old saplings, respectively. In these two species, the lignotubers have numerous buds protected by hypertrophied scales, and have a contorted xylem containing abundant starch. Our results challenge the traditional idea that pre-Mediterranean lineages suffered evolutionary inertia; instead, lignotuberous species may be considered examples of plants that adapted to the increased fire activity that occurred throughout the Tertiary and Quaternary. We also highlight the use of morpho-anatomical traits to unambiguously distinguish between lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous resprouting species.","[Paula, Susana] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Campus Isla Teja,Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile; [Naulin, Paulette I.; Arce, Cristian; Galaz, Consttanza] Univ Chile, Dept Silvicultura & Conservac Nat, Lab Biol Plantas, Santa Rosa 11-315,Casilla 9206, Santiago, Chile; [Pausas, Juli G.] CIDE CSIC, Ctra Naquera Km 4-5 IVIA, Valencia 46113, Spain","Pausas, JG (reprint author), CIDE CSIC, Ctra Naquera Km 4-5 IVIA, Valencia 46113, Spain.",juli.g.pausas@uv.es,"Naulin, Paulette/D-8234-2014; Pausas, Juli G/C-5794-2008","Naulin, Paulette/0000-0002-2166-2789; Pausas, Juli G/0000-0003-3533-5786","'Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico' from the Chilean government [FONDECYT 1120458]; 'Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas' (CSIC, Spain)Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) [0556]; TREVOL project from the Spanish government [CGL2012-39938-C02-00]; U-inicia; CSICConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana; University of Valencia","We are grateful for the invitation to participate in this special issue.

In many semi-arid environments, woody plants face both fire and drought as recurring disturbances. Past work has demonstrated that oaks inhabiting sky-island forests of the northern Sierra Madre Oriental have differing microhabitat preferences and heavy stem dieback occured during the historic 2011 drought indicating potential xylem failure. These oak species, representing two sections within the genus, are all post-fire resprouters: they can resprout from underground storage organs when fire kills above ground tissue. Resprouts provide an opportunity to examine how functional traits may change as plastic responses to changing environmental conditions. Post-fire resprouts have increased root:shoot ratios relative to adults and therefore have access to more water relative to leaf demand. We expected that if resprouts exhibit plasticity in xylem function, they should favor water transport efficiency over safety: they should have higher maximum xylem conductivity, but greater susceptibility to drought-induced cavitation. We examined four oak species common in the Davis Mountains in west Texas and compared adult physiology with that of resprouts following wildfire. We found that species differed in degree of desiccation avoidance (isohydry) consistent with microhabitat preferences and that the species that were most desiccation tolerant as adults had resprouts significantly more susceptible to xylem cavitation. We found no evidence for a trade-off between efficiency and safety, however.","[Schwilk, Dylan W.; Brown, Tailor E.; Lackey, Russell; Willms, Joshua] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 43131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Schwilk, DW (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 43131, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",dylan.schwilk@ttu.edu,,,Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch; USGS South-Central Climate Science Center; Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant through the Undergraduate Biological Sciences Education Program,"We thank Anna Jacobsen, Brandon Pratt, and Mike Tobin for sharing techniques and helping trouble-shoot our conductivity measurement methods.

However, key parameters that determine the degree of N regulation on terrestrial C sequestration have not been well quantified. Methods Here, we used a Bayesian probabilistic inversion approach to estimate 14 target parameters related to ecosystem C and N interactions from 19 datasets obtained from Duke Forests under ambient and elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). Important Findings Our results indicated that 8 of the 14 target parameters, such as C:N ratios in most ecosystem compartments, plant N uptake and external N input, were well constrained by available datasets whereas the others, such as N allocation coefficients, N loss and the initial value of mineral N pool were poorly constrained. Our analysis showed that elevated CO2 led to the increases in C:N ratios in foliage, fine roots and litter. Moreover, elevated CO2 stimulated plant N uptake and increased ecosystem N capital in Duke Forests by 25.2 and 8.5%, respectively. In addition, elevated CO2 resulted in the decrease of C exit rates (i.e. increases in C residence times) in foliage, woody biomass, structural litter and passive soil organic matter, but the increase of C exit rate in fine roots. Our results demonstrated that CO2 enrichment substantially altered key parameters in determining terrestrial C and N interactions, which have profound implications for model improvement and predictions of future C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems in response to global change.","[Shi, Zheng; Yang, Yuanhe; Zhou, Xuhui; Weng, Ensheng; Luo, Yiqi] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Yang, Yuanhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Finzi, Adrien C.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Yang, YH (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yhyang@ibcas.as.cn,"Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011; Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011; Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019","Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901","US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, DBI 0850290, EPS 0919466]; Office of Science (BER), Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-006ER64319]; Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University [DE-FC02-06ER64158]","This research was financially supported by US National Science Foundation (NSF) (DEB 0743778, DEB 0840964, DBI 0850290 and EPS 0919466); Office of Science (BER), Department of Energy (DE-FG02-006ER64319), Midwestern Regional Center of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research at Michigan Technological University (DE-FC02-06ER64158).",,59,12,12,2,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Hall), is often observed under extreme environmental conditions. We investigated the influence of host plant species, waterlogging and landscape zone (soil type) on colonisation by fine root endophyte. Colonisation by AM fungi and fine root endophyte was measured in Lolium rigidum Gaudin (ryegrass) and Lotus subbiflorus Lag. (lotus) sampled from the upper, middle and lower/riparian zones of a sloping pasture. Ryegrass and lotus were then grown in a glasshouse in soil from these three zones: waterlogging was initiated for half the pots from day 43 and colonisation determined 35 days later. In the field, AM fungal colonisation was lowest in the lower zone for ryegrass only. In the glasshouse, waterlogging greatly decreased AM fungal colonisation, with the exception of lotus in lower zone soil where colonisation by fine root endophyte was prolific. Waterlogging impacts on plant growth were small. Fine root endophyte better withstands the stressful conditions induced by waterlogging than other forms of AM fungi, but this response differs with host plant. Further study of the environmental niche of fine root endophyte is necessary to understand its function under extreme conditions.","[Orchard, S.; Nicol, D.; Ryan, M.

Under varying hydrological conditions, AMF communities in roots of different wetland species may respond differently due to hydrological and to physiological differences among plants. Here we test this hypothesis. AMF colonization intensity and community structure in the roots of two wetland plants with different flood tolerance (one aquatic and one semiaquatic) were characterized along a hydrologic gradient. A fragment covering partial SSU, the whole ITS and partial LSU rDNA region of AMF was amplified, cloned and sequenced from the roots of each host species. A total of 528 AMF sequences were obtained and sorted into 15 taxa based on phylogenetic analyses. A total of nine and 13 taxa, respectively, were found from the aquatic and semiaquatic host species; the AMF compositions of both sets of taxa were very similar. Intensive flooding inhibited the AMF colonization and diversity level in both cases, while moderate flooding caused distinctly different effects between the two wetland species. AMF diversity level in wetland habitat is not necessarily low, even if few morphological structures of AMF are detected in the roots. The effects of hydrologic conditions on AMF communities in wetlands depend on both the flooding intensity and the adaptations of the wetland hosts.","[Wang, Yutao; Li, Yingwei; Bao, Xiaozhe; Bjorn, Lars Olof; Li, Shaoshan] S China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou Key Lab Subtrop Biodivers & Biomonitori, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yutao; Li, Yingwei; Bao, Xiaozhe; Bjorn, Lars Olof; Li, Shaoshan] S China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecol & Environm Sci Guangdong Higher Educ, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Bjorn, Lars Olof; Olsson, Pal Axel] Lund Univ, Dept Microbial Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Wang, YT; Li, SS (reprint author), S China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou Key Lab Subtrop Biodivers & Biomonitori, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Wang, YT; Li, SS (reprint author), S China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecol & Environm Sci Guangdong Higher Educ, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangyutao@scnu.edu.cn; lishsh@scnu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31400365, 31070242]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2014A030310162]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20134407120005, 20114407110006]; Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou [2014J4100053]; Graduate Student Research Innovation Project of South China Normal University [2015lkxm22]","The authors are grateful to Dr. Nicholas Rosenstock (Lund University), Prof. Soren Rosendahl (University of Copenhagen) and two anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions and to Prof. Helen Ghiradella (The University at Albany) for language correction on the manuscript.

We conducted a litterbag experiment using two sizes of meshes and pursued the leaf and root decomposition of six major tree species in a Japanese temperate forest over 411-days to test the interactive effects of soil mesofauna and litter quality addressed based on two features (litter types and species) on the process. Moreover, given a possible correlation between litter traits of the leaves and roots, we examined whether soil mesofauna alters the relationship between leaf and root decomposition across species. We found that the effects of plant species identity was stronger than that of soil mesofauna for determining the litter mass loss rate and the microbial respiration rate in both above-ground and below-ground decomposition. In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between leaf and root litter decomposition processes, regardless of the involvement soil mesofauna. On the other hand, the presence of soil mesofauna increased microbial respiration rates in the early stage of leaf decomposition; however, soil mesofauna did not affect root microbial respiration rates during the experiment. Such differential involvement of mesofauna in the leaf and root litter decomposition may drive the general patterns of faster and slower decomposition of plant leaves and roots in the soil, respectively.","[Fujii, Saori; Takeda, Hiroshi] Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Environm Syst Sci, JP-6100394 Kyoto, Japan; [Fujii, Saori] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Dept Environm & Nat Sci, JP-2408501 Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Forest Hydrol, JP-6068502 Kyoto, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Mori, Akira S.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Dept Environm & Nat Sci, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, JP-2408501 Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Fujii, S (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Environm Syst Sci, JP-6100394 Kyoto, Japan.; Fujii, S (reprint author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Dept Environm & Nat Sci, JP-2408501 Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",sao@itak.or.jp,"Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013","Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198","ESPEC Foundation for Global Environment Research and Technology; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25850115]","Author contributions: SF and NM designed and conducted the experiment.

It is also common in warm and salt deserts, displaying a larger environmental tolerance than most native species. We tested the hypothesis that a suite of habitat-specific B. tectorum lineages dominates warm desert habitats. We sampled 30 B. tectorum Mojave Desert and desert fringe populations and genotyped 10-26 individuals per population using 69 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers. We compared these populations to 11 Great Basin steppe and salt desert populations. Populations from warm desert habitats were dominated by members of two haplogroups (87 % of individuals) that were distinct from haplogroups common in Great Basin habitats. We conducted common garden studies comparing adaptive traits and field performance among haplogroups typically found in different habitats. In contrast to the haplogroup abundant in sagebrush steppe, warm desert haplogroups generally lacked a vernalization requirement for flowering. The most widespread warm desert haplogroup (Warm Desert 1) also had larger seeds and a higher root: shoot ratio than other haplogroups. In the field, performance of warm desert haplogroups was dramatically lower than the sagebrush steppe haplogroup at one steppe site, but one warm desert haplogroup performed as well as the steppe haplogroup under drought conditions at the other site. Our results suggest that B. tectorum succeeds in widely disparate environments through ecotypic variation displayed by distinct lineages of plants. Accounting for this ecotypic variation is essential in modeling its future distribution in response to climate change.","[Meyer, Susan E.] USFS Rocky Mt Res Stn, Shrub Sci Lab, 735 North 500 East, Provo, UT 84606 USA; [Leger, Elizabeth A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St,MS 186, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Eldon, Desiree R.; Coleman, Craig E.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Meyer, SE (reprint author), USFS Rocky Mt Res Stn, Shrub Sci Lab, 735 North 500 East, Provo, UT 84606 USA.",semeyer@xmission.com,,,"USDA Cooperative State Research Service [2008-35320-18677]; Joint Fire Sciences Program [JFSP-2007-1-3-10, JFSP-2011-S-2-6]; Bureau of Land Management (Integrated Cheatgrass Die-off Research Project); University of Nevada Reno (start-up funds)","This work was supported in part by grants from the USDA Cooperative State Research Service (2008-35320-18677 to S.E.M. and C.E.C.), the Joint Fire Sciences Program (JFSP-2007-1-3-10, JFSP-2011-S-2-6 to S.E.M.), the Bureau of Land Management (Integrated Cheatgrass Die-off Research Project to S.E.M. and E.A.L.), and the University of Nevada Reno (start-up funds to E.A.L.).

Some plant facilitative interactions disappear during the ontogenetic development of the facilitated plant but others persist, even when the two plants are adults. We test whether the persistence of plant facilitative interactions is explained by the phylogenetic diversity of mutualistic and non-mutualistic fungi that the nurse and the facilitated species add to the shared rhizosphere. We classify plant facilitative interactions as persistent and non-persistent interactions and quantify the phylogenetic diversity of mutualistic and non-mutualistic fungi added by the plant species to the shared rhizosphere. Our results show that the facilitated species add less phylogenetic diversity of non-mutualistic fungi when plant facilitative interactions persist than when they do not persist. However, persistent and non-persistent facilitative interactions did not differ in the phylogenetic diversity of mutualistic fungi added by the facilitated species to the shared rhizosphere. Finally, the fungal phylogenetic diversity added by the nurse to the shared rhizosphere did not differ between persistent and non-persistent interactions. This study suggests that considering the fungal associates of the plant species involved in facilitative interactions can shed light on the mechanisms of persistence for plant-plant interactions.","[Montesinos-Navarro, Alicia; Segarra-Moragues, J.

Interior provenances gained a larger tolerance to drought after three breeding generations as shown by larger survival and root/shoot ratio under water shortage, while coastal provenance displayed an opposite trend. aEuro cent Context Given that rainfall is predicted to decrease and to affect establishment and early survival of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) in Chile, there is a need to identify more drought tolerant genotypes at seedling stage. aEuro cent Aims The aim of this study was to test whether provenances of P. radiata originating from interior or from coastal provenances, displayed different responses to short-term water shortage, and whether these responses differed from the first to the third breeding generation. aEuro cent Methods Three generations of breeding families from two sites in Central Chile were compared. The seedlings were grown during 100 days and subjected to two watering regimes for 45 days. Survival, growth, and biomass allocation to roots and shoots were recorded. aEuro cent Results The two provenances displayed different responses to drought. Biomass allocation to shoots and survival were significantly reduced by water shortage. The first generation seedlings from the coastal provenance displayed a larger survival rate when exposed to water shortage (i.e., 60 %); this rate decreased in the following breeding generations. On the contrary, the survival rate increased from the first to the third generation in the interior provenance. aEuro cent Conclusions We observed an important local adaptation to water shortage in the interior provenance. This response may be due to the fact that parent tree populations of the interior provenance have successfully adapted to sites with periodic drought.","[Espinoza, Sergio E.; Santelices, Romulo E.; Cabrera, Antonio M.] Univ Catolica Maule, Talca, Chile; [Magni, Carlos R.] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ivkovic, Milos] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Espinoza, SE (reprint author), Univ Catolica Maule, Talca, Chile.",espinoza@ucm.cl,,,National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) from the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONYCIT) [11121484],"This research was funded by the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) from the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONYCIT) (Initiation into Research Project No. 11121484 ""Identification of Pinus radiata D.

The experimental design was completely randomized, with a factorial design with two mycorrhizal levels [inoculated (+AMF) and control (-AMF)] x six phosphorus levels (3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33 mg dm(-3)). The presence of mycorrhizal structures, mycorrhizal growth, mycorrhizal efficiency, leaf relative water content (RWC) and gas exchange were evaluated. +AMF plants of both species had mycorrhizal structures, while -AMF showed no structures. In P. pyramidalis, +AMF plants had benefits with increasing phosphorus level, while -AMF plants had increases biomass only at the P9 level if compared to the P3-AMF level. The total leaf area was correlated with total dry weight (TDW) in +AMF and -AMF plants. However, +AMF plants had more responses in RWC. In C. quercifolius, +AMF and -AMF plants did not differ in RWC and showed reductions in gas exchange with increased phosphorus level. However, these reductions were lower in +AMF plants, besides having a better performance over -AMF plants. The growth and mycorrhizal efficiency were higher at the P15 level, and relationship between total leaf area and TDW were significant only in +AMF plants. Thus, both species perform association with AMF and show increases in growth. The concentrations of phosphorus in the soil for P. pyramidalis (33 mg dm(-3)) and C. quercifolius (15 mg dm(-3)) are indicated for increased effectiveness of mycorrhization, promote increases in gas exchange and growth in +AMF plants.

Although this mutualism depends on fair resource exchange between plants and fungi, inequality exists among partners despite mechanisms that regulate trade. Here, we use P-33 and C-14 isotopes and a split-root system to test for preferential allocation and reciprocal rewards in the plant-AMF symbiosis by presenting a plant with two AMF that differ in cooperativeness. We found that plants received more P-33 from less cooperative AMF in the presence of another AMF species. This increase in P-33 resulted in a reduced C-14 cost per unit of P-33 from less cooperative AMF when alternative options were available. Our results indicate that AMF diversity promotes cooperation between plants and AMF, which may be an important mechanism maintaining the evolutionary persistence of and diversity within the plant-AMF mutualism.","[Arguello, Alicia; O'Brien, Michael J.; van der Heijden, Marcel G.

Bio-based technology is among recommended practices for the recovery of PAH contaminated matrices. The objective of the study was to validate the exploitation of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), an organic waste deriving from the industrial production of Pleurotus ostreatus, as bulking agent in a dynamic biopile pilot plant, because of the SMS potential oxidative capacity towards aromatic recalcitrant compounds. The dynamic biopile pilot plant treated 7 tons of a historically PAH contaminated soil (6469 +/- 423 mg PAHs kg(-1)), classified as dangerous waste. RESULTS: The mixing of SMS with soil was mandatory for the depletion of PAHs, which after 8 months, were at significantly lower concentrations (112 +/- 5 mg PAHs kg(-1)). The treated soil was capable of reintroduction to the industrial site of origin. However, a residual genotoxicity of soil elutriates at the end of the process was measured on root tips of Vicia faba L. CONLUSIONS: The SMS derived from the industrial production of P. ostreatus is exploitable as a versatile low cost organic substrate with oxidative capacity towards PAHs and its exploitation as a bulking agent in biopiles is advantageous for the disposal of the organic waste.

However, information about intra-vs. interspecific variation among the genes commonly used in diversity surveys is limited. Here, the nuclear small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene portions were sequenced from 3 to 5 individual spores from each of two isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis and Gigaspora margarita. A total of 1482 Sanger sequences (0.5 Mb) from 239 clones were obtained, spanning similar to 4370 bp of the ribosomal operon when concatenated. Intrasporal and intra-isolate sequence variation was high for all three regions even though variant numbers were not exhausted by sequencing 12-40 clones per isolate. Intra-isolate nucleotide variation levels followed the expected order of ITS > LSU > SSU, but the values were strongly dependent on isolate identity. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) densities over 4 SNP/kb in the ribosomal operon were detected in all four isolates. Automated operational taxonomic unit picking within the sequence set of known identity overestimated species richness with almost all cut-off levels, markers and isolates. Average intraspecific sequence similarity values were 99%, 96% and 94% for amplicons in SSU, LSU and ITS, respectively. The suitability of the central part of the SSU as a marker for AM fungal community surveys was further supported by its level of nucleotide variation, which is similar to that of the ITS region; its alignability across the entire phylum; its appropriate length for next-generation sequencing; and its ease of amplification in single-step PCR.","[Thiery, Odile; Vasar, Martti; Jairus, Teele; Davison, John; Saks, Ulle; Moora, Mari; Zobel, Martin; Opik, Maarja] Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [Roux, Christophe] Univ Toulouse, UPS, Lab Rech Sci Vegetales, CNRS, 24 Chemin Borde Rouge Auzeville,BP 42617, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Kivistik, Paula-Ann; Metspalu, Andres; Milani, Lili] Univ Tartu, Estonian Genome Ctr, 23b Riia St, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia","Opik, M (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Dept Bot, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",maarja.opik@ut.ee,"Milani, Lili/N-1097-2019; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009; Opik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Zobel, Martin/H-1336-2015; Christophe, Roux/V-5058-2017","Milani, Lili/0000-0002-5323-3102; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506; Opik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Zobel, Martin/0000-0001-7957-6704; Christophe, Roux/0000-0001-5688-5379; Vasar, Martti/0000-0002-4674-932X","Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [9050, 9157]; Estonian Targeted Financing [IUT20-28, IUT24-6, TAP48-2]; European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange); European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence for Genomics and Translational Medicine (GenTransMed))","We thank Drs.

We investigated how N availability, N-impacted soil communities and drought affect feedback in seedlings of a drought-deciduous mycorrhizal shrub, Artemisia californica. Seedlings were inoculated with soil from either a high or low deposition site or sterilized inoculum and grown with or without supplemental N and under well-watered or drought-stressed conditions. Inoculum, N and water had interactive effects on feedbacks. Seedlings grown in low deposition inoculum exhibited a neutral to positive feedback under drought and had the highest root to shoot ratios and mycorrhizal colonization. Seedlings inoculated with high N-deposition soil experienced a positive feedback when N fertilized and well-watered, but plants allocated large amounts of biomass to shoots and had a negative response to drought. The soil community mediates plant response to varying belowground resource availability. We found N-impacted communities may reduce mycorrhizal colonization and allocation to roots and provide less protection against drought. Our results highlight the context dependency of plant-soil feedbacks and the potential for climate change and N deposition to have interactive effects on these relationships.","[Valliere, Justin M.; Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Allen, Edith B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Valliere, JM (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",jvall007@ucr.edu,,,California Native Plant Society's Educational Grant; National Park Service Air Resource Division [J8C07110022],"This research was funded in part by the California Native Plant Society's Educational Grant and the National Park Service Air Resource Division (TASK AGREEMENT NO.

In this study, we compared the partitioning and variations of biomass and carbon concentration for four tree components (i.e. stem, root, branch, and foliage). The results indicated that foliage had the largest carbon concentration, which was significantly different from other tree components. Above-ground biomass or carbon accounted for about 78% of the total tree biomass or carbon, whereas below-ground biomass or carbon corresponded to about 22%. The root-to-shoot ratio averaged .28 for biomass and .27 for carbon. We applied likelihood analysis to investigate the error structure of allometric relationship W=a.D-b and found that the multiplicative error structure was favored. Thus, the additive systems of biomass and carbon equations in a log-transformed scale were constructed using nonlinear seemly unrelated regression. The model fitting results showed that all biomass and carbon equations fitted the data well. Further, five approaches for calculating carbon stock of individual trees were evaluated and compared. The carbon allometric equations and the estimated biomass multiplied by weighted mean carbon concentration were more advantageous, whereas using the generic carbon concentration constants produced significant biases in estimating the carbon stock of individual trees.","[Dong, Lihu; Li, Fengri] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lianjun] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Forest & Nat Resources Management, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Li, FR (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Harbin, Peoples R China.",fengrili@126.com,,,"Scientific Research Funds for Forestry Public Welfare of China [201004026]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2012BAD22B02]",This work was supported by the Scientific Research Funds for Forestry Public Welfare of China [grant number 201004026]; the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [grant number 2012BAD22B02].,,66,1,1,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

Little is known about the diversity of bacteria in the root nodules of this species and how this diversity is associated with N-2 fixation efficiency. We isolated 288 bacterial colonies from root nodules collected from M. scabrella in 61 locations across its native range. Strains were first characterized according to morphological traits and 16S rRNA sequencing and we then selected twenty-eight belonging to known nodulating genera for testing N-2 fixation effectiveness. We found that M. scabrella associated with several N-2 fixing and endophytic bacteria. Strains closely related to Burkholderia nodosa were the most common N-2 fixing bacteria and were capable of providing all N required by the host. Cupriavidus was found nodulating M. scabrella, however, only forming non-fixing nodules. Endophytic bacteria detected in the nodules corresponded to the genera Pseudomonas, Pantoea, and, for the first time we found Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Serratia and Arthrobacter. Our study shows both high bacterial diversity and variability in N-2 fixing effectiveness even between closely related Burkholderia strains, indicating that careful consideration of N-2 fixing bacterial diversity is important to maximize the use of M. scabrella as a natural resource.

Research sites were located in southern Poland on an afforested sand mine pit (Szczakowa) and a sulphur mine spoil heap (Piaseczno). Study plots were arranged in pure tree stands of pine, larch, oak, birch and alder with 25- to 35-year-old trees growing on different RMS substrates: quaternary sands; quaternary loamy sands and loams; neogene clays; and mixed quaternary sands and neogene clay. Microbial biomass carbon depended mainly on the texture, TOC and TN content in the uppermost soil layer, whereas DHA was associated with the fine root annual increment. Earthworm biomass was significantly correlated with clay content, pH and TOC in the uppermost organic soil layers. Among planted tree species, black alder clearly altered soil microbial parameters, biomass and density of earthworms. The strongest effect on DHA was noted under birch trees. Among the studied tree species, deciduous trees (birch, alder and oak) had a greater impact on soil biological properties compared to coniferous trees (pine and larch). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed 318 field measurements of forest biomass in this region, which 62 sites were obtained from our field measurements and the others from the national forest inventory. The results showed that the average above-ground biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) were 134 Mg/ha and 28 Mg/ha, respectively. The root/shoot biomass ratio (R/S) ranged between 0.06 and 0.81, with an average of 0.22. Forest stand characteristics explained 43% and 21% of the variation in AGB and BGB, respectively, while climate only explained 2-4%, reflecting the strong effect of forest features on biomass. However, only 5% of the R/S ratio was explained by climate, soil chemistry, and stand characteristics, suggesting that these factors had no significant effect on biomass allocation. In addition, the scaling exponents between AGB and BGB did not differ significantly from 1, and did not vary with mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, longitude, latitude, altitude, soil pH, soil total nitrogen concentration, and stand age, but did vary with soil total phosphorus concentration, stand density, and forest type. Our findings suggest that stand characteristics have a marked impact on forest biomass, and root biomass scales isometrically with above-ground biomass in southwest China.

By contrast, N addition significantly increased the total vegetation C pools. The C pools in the LN, MN and HN treatments increased by 22, 39 and 44 %, respectively. MN produced the largest effect among the N concentrations, although differences between N-added treatments were not significant (P > 0.05). N addition significantly reduced the ratio of root:shoot (R:S) (P = 0.03).

However, to date, a direct comparison of AMF primers for soil samples, which would systematically assess their amplification efficiency, is still missing. In our present study, we compared and characterized four widely used primer sets targeting AMF 18S rDNA or SSU-ITS-LSU rDNA from three soil samples as follows: (1) SSUmAf/LSUmAr + SSUmCf/LSUmBr, (2) GeoA2/Geo11 + NS31/AM1, (3) AML1/AML2 + NS31/AM1 and (4) AMV4.5NF/AMDGR. These primer sets were compared in terms of the proportion of Glomeromycota detected, AMF diversity and community composition. Our data revealed that the newly combined primer set 3 was the most suitable one for amplifying AMF from soil samples. It yielded the highest AMF alpha diversity, and was very specific to Glomeromycota. Primer set 2 was unable to amplify Claroideoglomus from soil 1, which was the dominant AMF clade as proved by other three primer sets. Primer set 4 demonstrated its instability among different soil samples, since the proportion of AMF in total sequences varied from 5% to 83%. Although primer set 1 showed the highest proportion of AMF (95-100%) in the soil samples, it captured the lowest AMF diversity, and the operational taxonomic units obtained by this primer set were only 36.4% of that by primer set 4. Taken together, our data suggested that AMF diversity in soil samples could be underestimated by primer set 1, 2 and 4. Our result confirmed the important role of the choice of AMF primers for analyzing AMF communities in soil and explored the most suitable one for amplifying AMF from soil samples.","[Xiang, Dan; Li, Huan] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Dan; Chen, Baodong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Li, H (reprint author), Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",lihuancomcomcom@163.com,"Chen, Baodong/A-7707-2009","Chen, Baodong/0000-0002-1790-7800","Advanced Talents Foundation of QAU [6631115031]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41501271, 31301854]",This work was supported by Advanced Talents Foundation of QAU [grant number 6631115031] and National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41501271 and 31301854].,,31,0,0,8,90,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,1651-1913,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

Plant-fungal interactions can have strong effects on plant abundances, both through direct effects on plant performance and indirect effects on competition and facilitation. Most evidence linking fungi to plant abundances derives from direct fungal effects on initial growth, with little evidence linking fungal effects on plant-plant interactions in intact communities to plant abundances for any plant life-history stage. 2. We transplanted 4320 individuals belonging to 18 plant species into plots where we removed neighbouring vegetation and suppressed fungi using fungicide in a factorial design. We monitored plant survival and growth for 3 years, using these data to test whether fungi had net effects on how plant-plant interactions affected different plant life-history components (initial survival/growth, adult survival/growth). We then tested whether these indirect fungal effects or direct fungal effects on plant performance best explained plant commonness (frequency of occurrence) and local density (per cent cover). Finally, we measured differences in root-associated fungi following fungal suppression and associated these differences with fungal effects on plant performance. 3. Overall, fungi increased competitive effects on survival (i.e. lower survival with fungi intact), but reduced competitive effects on growth of adult plants (i.e. higher growth when fungi intact). Among the focal species, these indirect fungal effects increased survival for more common species relative to rarer species. However, indirect fungal effects on adult growth benefitted rarer species more than common species. Local plant densities were unassociated with indirect fungal effects, but were negatively associated with direct fungal effects on survival and adult growth. This suggests that fungi limit local dominance, thereby indirectly increasing the establishment of common species and the growth of rare species. 4. Synthesis. Using a variety of plant species and suppressing both fungi and neighbours, we show that fungi have net indirect effects, through plant-plant interactions, within intact plant communities. Variation among species in both direct and indirect fungal effects contributed to plant abundances, yet fungal effects did not consistently benefit either common or rare species. However, regardless of commonness, fungi directly reduced growth and survival for species with high local densities, consistent with plant-soil feedbacks limiting species dominance.","[Bennett, Jonathan A.; Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Bennett, Jonathan A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.; Bennett, JA (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Biol, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",jon.a.bennett@gmail.com,"Cahill, James/B-6147-2015","Cahill, James/0000-0002-4110-1516",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC DAS; ACA Biodiversity Grant; NSERC PGS-D scholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC Alberta QEII scholarship; Estonian Research CouncilEesti Teadusfond (ETF) [PUTJD15],"We would like to P.

In forest communities, the Janzen-Connell (J-C) hypothesis proposes that species diversity is maintained by non-competitive distance-and/or density-dependent seedling mortality caused by host-specific natural enemies. However, the effects of pathogen associations from nearby conspecifics versus heterospecifics remain unknown in spatially heterogeneous light environments. 2. Seeds of hardwood species Cornus controversa (Cornus) and Prunus grayana (Prunus) were sown beneath 6-7 Cornus and Prunus adults in both the forest understory (FU) and in gaps (Gap) created by felling all woody vegetation near the focal adults. Seedling growth, mortality, killing agents (e.g. pathogens that cause damping-off and leaf diseases), and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated. 3. We found strong habitat effects on the expression of soil fungi beneath both tree species. Seedling mortality caused by soil-borne damping-off pathogens was greater in FU than in Gap, and AMF infection, which enhanced relative seedling growth rate, was greater in Gap than in FU. Seedling mortality caused by damping-off pathogens did not differ between Cornus and Prunus seedlings beneath the adults of conspecific or heterospecific adults in both FU and Gap, suggesting little distance-dependence or host preference in the fungus. 4. Beneath the adults of Cornus and Prunus, the most prevalent leaf diseases were zonate leaf blight and angular leaf spot caused by the airborne pathogenic fungi Haradamyces foliicola and Phaeoisariopsis pruni-grayanae, respectively. Although these pathogens attacked the seedlings of both species, conspecific seedlings (i.e. home) showed more severe leaf damage, earlier leaf shedding and/or less defensive behaviour (cell wall defence) relative to heterospecific seedlings (i.e. away), suggesting negative distance-dependent attack (i.e. host preference) for these leaf diseases. As a result, greater seedling mortality was observed for conspecific seedlings under both FU and Gap treatments. 5. Synthesis. In the temperate forest, the J-C hypothesis is largely mediated through the strong negative influence of airborne leaf diseases rather than through soil-borne damping-off pathogens. We found that airborne diseases demonstrated distance-dependent host preferences, which led to greater conspecific seedling damage regardless of environmental light conditions.","[Bayandala; Fukasawa, Yu; Seiwa, Kenji] Tohoku Univ, Forest Ecol, Naruko, Miyagi 9896711, Japan","Seiwa, K (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Forest Ecol, Naruko, Miyagi 9896711, Japan.",seiwa@bios.tohoku.ac.jp,"Fukasawa, Yu/N-4845-2018",,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [23380079]","We thank Tomonori Sasaki and members of the Laboratory of Forest Ecology, Tohoku University, for help with the experiments.

Thirteen bacterial isolates were characterized by RFLP analysis of the IGS region, and sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA and the symbiotic nodC and nifH genes. Isolates were ascribed to the genera Ensifer or Rhizobium, and phylogenetic analyses of the symbiotic genes allowed relating them to rhizobial strains of American origin, probably comprising a new symbiovar. Most strains formed highly effective nitrogen-fixing indeterminate nodules with V. macracantha. Nodules presented distinctive structural characteristics, including tannin deposits in the inner cortex and a cap of cells with dense vacuole content over an area of intermingled meristematic and freshly infected cells in the apical central zone. Typical zones I, II and interzone of indeterminate nodules were not clearly defined. Unusually complex mitochondrial structures were observed in mature and senescent infected cells of nitrogen-fixing nodules. The effect of inoculation on seedling growth and physiology was evaluated in both V. macracantha and the often co-existing non-nodulating tree legume Caesalpinia spinosa. Inoculation had an overall positive effect on the growth of V. macracantha seedlings, which correlated with the symbiotic effectiveness of isolates, and some strains significantly improved the photochemical efficiency of C. spinosa. To our knowledge, this is the first report on V. macracantha nodulating rhizobia and nodule structure and ultrastructure. This work provides the basis for the formulation of effective inoculants to be used in restoration programmes in the Andean region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Springtails (Collembola) that feed on fungal spores and mycelia may contribute to dispersal through carrying fungal propagules in their guts or on their appendages. The Collembola-fungal associations are mainly investigated by microscopy or culturing techniques, which allow identify only fungi that have distinctive morphological characteristics or that can be cultured in vitro. Here we identified the Collembola-associated fungi on the body surface and in the gut content using both culturing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. We studied three epigeic Collembola species found on the Norway spruce dominated forest stands throughout the vegetation period - Entomobrya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens and Pogonognathellus longicornis. We discovered over 1200 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e. the proxies for species, based on 97% sequence similarity of the ITS2 subregion of ribosomal DNA. Most of the fungi were saprotrophs, but we detected also mycorrhizal, parasitic and lichenized fungi. Season was the most important factor affecting fungal richness and composition, especially on body surface. Although the data matrix revealed significant effect of substrate, we were unable to detect the significant fungal community differences between body surface and gut samples of conspecifics. There were no significant differences among studied epigeic Collembola species in the preference for fungal diet. Our study demonstrates that collembolans associate with a broader range of fungi than previously observed and thus potentially play an important role in enhancing fungal colonization through dispersal activities.

The real-time PCR-based techniques are faster, more sensitive, more easily automated, and do not require post-amplification procedures. Species-specific primers for Phytophthora were designed based on the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of rDNA collected from the NCBI DNA database. Primers and probes were designed using the Allele ID 7 at default search criteria. Specific probes were labeled with the reporter dyes JOE (6-carboxy-4,5-dichloro-2,7-dimethoxyfluorescein) at the 5' end and HBQ1 quencher at the 3' end (Sigma-Aldrich). The specificity of primers and fluorogenic probes was tested against genomic DNA of P. alni subsp. multiformis, P. lacustris and P taxon hungarica. The real-time PCR reactions with the specific probes and primers yielded positive results with five concentrations of standards obtained by standard PCR reaction for corresponding Phytophthora species. The negative control (lack of DNA pathogens) yielded no amplification products. Standard curves showed a linear correlation between input DNA and cycle threshold (Ct) values with R-2 from 0.994 (P alni) to 0.998 (P. taxon hungarica). The amplification efficiency of target DNA varied from 94.6% (P alni) to 100% (P. taxon hungarica). The validation of the primers and probes designed for analysed Phytophthora species was performed on pure cultures, on soil samples from the forest nursery and declining oak stands. The designed probes displayed the high specificity of the detection of investigated species in pure cultures. The presented new molecular TaqMan probes can fully assist the integrated pest management as a powerful tool for a quick detection of above pathogenic organisms in forest nurseries. The molecular detection of harmful phytophthoras and in consequences diminishing of fungicides use for their control in forestry fully support European Union directives as well as the 'Good plant protection practice measures' elaborated by European and Mediterranean Organisation of Plant Protection.","[Nowakowska, Justyna A.; Tereba, Anna; Borys, Malgorzata] Inst Badawczy Lesnictwa, Lab Biol Mol, Ul Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland; [Malewski, Tadeusz] Muzeum & Inst Zool PAN, Ul Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Oszako, Tomasz] Politech Bialostocka, Zamiejscowy Wydzial Lesny & Hajnowce, Ul Pilsudskiego 8, PL-17200 Hajnowka, Poland","Nowakowska, JA (reprint author), Inst Badawczy Lesnictwa, Lab Biol Mol, Ul Braci Lesnej 3, PL-05090 Raszyn, Poland.",J.Nowakowska@ibles.waw.pl; tmalewski@miiz.waw.pl; T.Oszako@ibles.waw.pl,"Oszako, Tomasz/P-3955-2016; Malewski, Tadeusz/N-6883-2019; Nowakowska, Justyna/P-7860-2019","Oszako, Tomasz/0000-0003-4688-2582; Malewski, Tadeusz/0000-0001-8061-435X; Nowakowska, Justyna/0000-0001-5863-053X",,,,10,2,2,2,11,POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO LESNE,WARSZAWA,"KOMITET REDAKCYJNY SYLWANA, UL BITWY WARSZAWSKIEJ 1920 R NR 3, WARSZAWA, PL-02 362, POLAND",0039-7660,,,SYLWAN,Sylwan,MAY,2016,160,5,,,,,365,370,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,DN7CW,WOS:000377233900002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Li, XY; Rennenberg, H; Simon, J",,,,"Li, Xiuyuan; Rennenberg, Heinz; Simon, Judy",,,Seasonal variation in N uptake strategies in the understorey of a beech-dominated N-limited forest ecosystem depends on N source and species,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,inorganic N; N allocation patterns; net N uptake; N pools; organic N,SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SPRUCE PICEA-ABIES; EUROPEAN BEECH; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; NITROGEN UPTAKE; ORGANIC NITROGEN; AMINO-ACIDS; COMPETITIVE INTERFERENCE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EUCALYPTUS-REGNANS,"In forest ecosystems, species use different strategies to increase their competitive ability for nitrogen (N) acquisition. The acquisition of N by trees is regulated by tree internal and environmental factors including mycorrhizae. In this study, we investigated the N uptake strategies of three co-occurring tree species [European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.)] in the understorey of a beech-dominated, N-limited forest on calcareous soil over two consecutive seasons. For this purpose, we studied N-15 uptake capacity as well as the allocation to N pools in the fine roots. Our results show that European beech had a higher capacity for both inorganic and organic N acquisition throughout the whole growing season compared with sycamore maple and Norway maple. The higher capacity of N acquisition in beech indicates a better adaption of beech to the understorey conditions of beech forests compared with the seedlings of other tree competitors under N-limited conditions. Despite these differences, all three species preferred organic over inorganic N sources throughout the growing season and showed similar seasonal patterns of N acquisition with an increased N uptake capacity in summer. However, this pattern varied with N source and year indicating that other environmental factors not assessed in this study further influenced N acquisition by the seedlings of the three tree species.","[Li, Xiuyuan; Rennenberg, Heinz; Simon, Judy] Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Tree Physiol, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Simon, Judy] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Plant Physiol & Biochem, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Simon, J (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Forest Sci, Chair Tree Physiol, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.; Simon, J (reprint author), Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Plant Physiol & Biochem, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",judy.simon@uni-konstanz.de,"Simon, Judy/C-7875-2011","Simon, Judy/0000-0002-8879-2449","China Scholarship Council under CSCChina Scholarship Council [2009630074]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg","X.L. was financially supported by a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council under CSC no. 2009630074.

Many studies have shown root respiration to increase with an increase in root tissue nitrogen (N) concentration across species and study sites. Studies have also shown that both root respiration and root N concentration typically decrease with root age. The effects of added N may directly increase respiration of existing roots or may affect respiration by shifting the age structure of a root population by stimulating growth. To the best of our knowledge, no study has ever examined the effect of added N as a function of root age on root respiration. In this study, root respiration of 13-year-old Populus tremuloides Michx. trees grown in the field and 1-year-old P. tremuloides seedlings grown in containers was analyzed for the relative influence of root age and root N concentration independent of root age on root respiration. Field roots were first tracked using root windows and then sampled at known age. Nitrogen was either applied or not to small patches beneath the windows. In a pot experiment, each plant was grown with its root system split between two separate pots and N was applied at three different levels, either at the same or at different rates between pots. Root N concentration ranged between 1.4 and 1.7% in the field experiment and 1.8 and 2.6% in the seedling experiment. We found that addition of N increased root N concentration of only older roots in the field but of roots of all ages in the potted seedlings. In both experiments, the age-dependent decline in root respiration was largely consistent, and could be explained by a negative power function. Respiration decreased similar to 50% by 3 weeks of age. Although root age was the dominant factor affecting respiration in both experiments, in the field experiment, root N also contributed to root respiration independent of root age. These results add further insight into respiratory responses of roots to N addition and mechanisms underlying the tissue N-respiration relationship.","[Ceccon, Christian; Tagliavini, Massimo; Schmitt, Armin Otto] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Univ Sq 5, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Ceccon, Christian; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 201 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Eissenstat, DM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 201 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dme9@psu.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OEI-0613832, IOS-1120482]; Free University of Bozen - Bolzano within the project 'Ecological and physiological consequences of soil nitrogen availability for trees and herbaceous plants'",This research was partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (OEI-0613832; IOS-1120482) to D.M.E. and partially funded by the Free University of Bozen - Bolzano within the project 'Ecological and physiological consequences of soil nitrogen availability for trees and herbaceous plants' to M.T.,,44,6,6,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2016,36,5,,,,,618,627,,10.1093/treephys/tpw022,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,DN9MI,WOS:000377403300008,27095257,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Tang, B; Yin, CY; Wang, YJ; Sun, YY; Liu, Q",,,,"Tang, Bo; Yin, Chunying; Wang, Yujie; Sun, Yuyu; Liu, Qing",,,Positive effects of night warming on physiology of coniferous trees in late growing season: Leaf and root,ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gas exchange; Net influx of NH4+ and NO3- in root; Root nitrate reductase activity; Root physiology,NITRATE REDUCTASE-ACTIVITY; ELEVATED CO2; ABIES-FAXONIANA; SPECIES RICHNESS; TEMPERATE STEPPE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PICEA-ASPERATA; PLANT BIOMASS; CHLOROPHYLL-A; FINE ROOTS,"Previous studies about the effects of experimental warming on tree species have focused primarily on response of morphology and physiology in leaf and biomass allocation in the growing season, and a few studies considered the importance of roots. Based on the available evidence, it is unclear whether photosynthesis rate is enhanced by night warming in late autumn an issue that deserves further investigation. Thus, we exposed two coniferous species, Picea asperata and Abies faxoniana, to night warming continued throughout the year to investigate morphological and physiological responses of roots and leaves in the autumn. The results showed that night warming caused significant increases in net influxes of NH4+ and NO3- in P. asperata seedlings corresponding well with net H+ efflux and net influx of O-2. Meanwhile, night warming had a positive effect on foliar gas exchange such as net photosynthesis rate, apparent quantum efficiency, dark respiration rate and maximum quantum efficiency of PS II, and nitrate reductase activity of roots. Additionally, root morphology such as total roots length, surface area, specific root area and specific root length was also stimulated by night warming. In contrast, night warming decreased concentrations of non-structural carbohydrate in leaves and roots of both species in autumn. The present study demonstrates that night warming would enhance late autumn leaf photosynthetic rate, and increase N uptake capacity of roots. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

B.S.P.) in post-fire landscapes in eastern Canada often exhibit stunted growth in the presence of ericaceous shrubs such as Kalmia angustifolia L. After a period of stunted growth, some seedlings experience a growth release, exhibiting growth rates closer to normally growing seedlings. We hypothesized that an increase in colonization of root tips by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi is responsible for this release and that the percentage of root tips colonized by ECM fungi would be higher on seedlings that had a released or normally growing neighbour within close proximity. We quantified ECM fungi diversity and abundance from 255 soil cores from stunted, released, and normally growing black spruce seedlings sampled in two Kalmia-dominated sites in Newfoundland. Growth and microsite characteristics around each seedling were also measured. We found that normal and released seedlings had significantly higher proportions of ECM fungi root tips than stunted seedlings, supporting our final hypothesis; however, there was no significant difference in distance between neighbours. Soil chemical properties are thought to inhibit the vegetative spread of ECM fungi species in this particular system and are identified as an important topic for further research.","[St Martin, Philippe; Mallik, Azim U.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Mallik, AU (reprint author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",amallik@lakeheadu.ca,,,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2014-06239],"This study was supported by a Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Discovery Grant (no.

In addition, the potential mechanism of how climate warming influences soil N cycling via root-soil interactions remains unclear. We performed an experiment in which in situ root exudates were collected from Picea asperata seedling to examine the response of root carbon (C) & N exudation rates and the C: N ratio stoichiometry along with the soil N transformation rates to warming using infrared heaters in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that warming enhanced root C exudation rates (ug C g(-1) root biomass h(-1)), with higher C: N ratio stoichiometry simultaneously. Experimental warming also significantly increased the soil net mineralization rates, net nitrification rates, and denitrification rates. Then, we conducted an in vitro experiment in which three bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Nitrobacter hamburgensis, and Brachymonas denitrificans) representing ammonifiers, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers, respectively, were cultured with exudates as the culture media. The results indicated that root exudates collected in warmed plots significantly stimulated the growth of the three soil N transformation bacteria, compared with the treatments in control plots. Collectively, our results, to some degree, evidence a linkage that climate warming-induced changes in C fluxes and C: N ratio stoichiometry of root exudation stimulated the growth and reproduction of soil N transformation bacteria, consequently accelerating the soil organic matter decomposition and soil N transformations.

To address this, we twice removed 30% and 70% leaf area of seedlings of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertn., var. Hycrest II) and the native bluebunch wheatgrass (Psuedoroegnaria spicata [Pursh] A. Love, var Anatone) and compared A(net) and aboveground and belowground growth of these to unclipped control plants. Compensatory A(net) occurred only after the second clipping, roughly 1 month after the first, and was similar in magnitude and duration between species and treatments, ca. 26% higher than control plant A(net) for 2 weeks following clipping. Despite similar compensatory A(net) between species, increases in A(net) were more proportional with increased stomatal conductance to water vapor (g(s)) in crested wheatgrass. This resulted in higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi = A(net)/g(s)) integrated across the post-clipping recovery period compared with WUEi of bluebunch seedlings, which declined with clipping. Differences in WUEi were attributable to differences in root-to-shoot ratios and root tissue quality (specific root mass; g dry mass . m(-2) root area), which were lower in crested wheatgrass. We concluded that compensatory photosynthesis is an important component of seedling herbivory tolerance, and that observed differences in post-herbivory WUEi could help improve management strategies by informing seedling selection criteria to help develop methods aimed at minimizing impacts of herbivory during the seedling stage.

Altogether, 50 AMF species were identified; the genera Acaulospora, Funneliformis and Glomus were predominant. The AM fungal community differed among areas A, B and C. A higher isolation frequency and relative abundance of Acaulospora, Ambispora, Entrophospora and Paraglomus were observed in areas A and B; however, Claroideoglomus, Diversispora, Sclerocystis and Septoglomus were more abundant in Area C. The highest spore density occurred in Area C, and was slightly lower in Area A and lowest in Area B. Conversely, species richness and diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener and evenness indices) were the highest in Area A, followed by areas C and B. Based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses, the distribution of AMF was influenced by plant host, fertilization practice and environmental factors. Among them, the soil physicochemical properties were the main drivers affecting AMF, in which three edaphic attributes (carbon/nitrogen ratio, available phosphorus and potassium content) were significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with the AM fungal community composition in the three areas of the drawdown zone of the TGR.","[Luo, Xie; Su, Xiaolei; Cui, Jingmiao; Lou, Ya; Luo, Xiumei; Zeng, Yuanqin; Xu, Yaobo; Dong, Jinyan] Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Li, Ru] Yunnan Agr Univ, Sch Plant Protect, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Dong, JY (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",donjyaa@swu.edu.cn,,"Zeng, Yifeng/0000-0002-5246-403X",Natural Science Foundation of ChongqingNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2012jjA20012]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270091]; Scientific Research Foundation of Southwest University [swu109046],"The authors thank anonymous referees for constructive comments and suggestions that improved the manuscript.

We aimed to elucidate whether a selection of annual and perennial Trifolium (clover) species have lost associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in their introduced range. Location Introduced range in New Zealand (NZ) and native range in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods We compared the strain richness of rhizobia associated with five Trifolium species in both ranges using genetic fingerprinting (rep-PCR with ERIC primers). Phylogenetic analysis of the nodD gene was conducted to test for between-range differences in rhizobia genotypes associated with seven Trifolium species. We also used TRFLP to compare the richness of AMF associated with three Trifolium species in both ranges. Results Genetic fingerprinting indicated that Trifolium associate with a similar richness of rhizobia strains in NZ as they do in the UK. According to variation in the nodD gene, genotypes of rhizobia were indistinguishable between NZ and UK provenances. A total of 17 AMF operational taxonomic units were detected but there were no significant between-range differences in richness or in community structure. Main conclusions Contrary to general expectations regarding the loss of mutualists following species introduction, our findings suggest that alien plants, including those accidentally introduced, can have access to rich communities of soil-borne mutualists that are likely to facilitate successful naturalization.","[McGinn, Kevin J.; Shelby, Natasha; Weser, Carolin; Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 85084, Licoln 7647, New Zealand; [van der Putten, Wim H.; Weser, Carolin] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands; [Duncan, Richard P.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","McGinn, KJ (reprint author), Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 85084, Licoln 7647, New Zealand.",kevinmcginn@outlook.com,"Duncan, Richard P/E-7899-2013; Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Shelby, Natasha/I-5818-2019; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Duncan, Richard P/0000-0003-2295-449X; Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Shelby, Natasha/0000-0001-9097-3663; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New ZealandRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ); Bio-Protection Research Centre writing scholarship,"We thank Henk Martens for performing TRFLP lab work and staff at Lincoln University and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology for assistance, including: Carla Oplaat, Ian Dickie, Saskia Gerards, Agata Pijl and Tanja Bakx-Schotman.

We sought to determine if tree size (DBH) effects GPR root detection proximal to longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill) and if corrections for could be applied to stand-level estimates of root mass. GPR (1500 MHz) was used to estimate coarse root mass proximal to 33 longleaf pine trees and compared to the amount of biomass excavated from pits proportional in area to tree basal diameter. Lateral roots were excavated to a depth of 1 m and taproots were excavated in their entirety. GPR underestimated longleaf pine below-stump mass and the magnitude of the underestimation increased with tree DBH. Non-linear regressions between GPR estimated root mass/excavated root mass and tree diameter at breast height (DBH) were highly significant for both below-stump (lateral + taproot) root mass (p < 0.0001, R-2 0.77) and lateral coarse root mass (p < 0.0001, R-2 0.65). GPR underestimates root mass proximal to trees, and this needs to be accounted for to accurately estimate stand-level belowground biomass.","[Butnor, John R.] Univ Vermont, USDA, Aiken Ctr, Forest Serv,Southern Res Stn, 81 Carrigan Dr,Room 208, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Johnsen, Kurt H.] USDA, Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 1577 Brevard Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 USA; [Samuelson, Lisa J.; Stokes, Thomas A.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, 3301 SFWS Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Anderson, Peter H.] USDA, Forest Serv, Southern Res Stn, 3041 East Cornwallis Rd, Durham, NC 27709 USA; [Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos A.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Engn Resources & Management, 280 Peavy Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Butnor, JR (reprint author), Univ Vermont, USDA, Aiken Ctr, Forest Serv,Southern Res Stn, 81 Carrigan Dr,Room 208, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",jbutnor@fs.fed.us,"Butnor, John/P-9738-2016","Butnor, John/0000-0003-0602-3898",U.

The number of PORs within plant species is limited to one to four isoforms, with the most common being two PORs per plant. These enzymes provide electrons to a huge number of different cytochromes P450s (from 50 to several hundred within one plant). Within the eudicotyledons, PORs can be divided into two major clades, POR 1 and POR 2. Based on our own sequencing analysis and publicly available data, we have identified 45 PORs from the angiosperm order Apiales. These were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis along with 237 other publicly available (NCBI and oneKP) POR sequences found within the Glade Asterids. Here, we show that the order Apiales only harbor members of the POR 2 Glade, which are further divided into two distinct subclades. This is in contrast to most other eudicotyledon orders that have both POR 1 and POR 2. This suggests that through gene duplications and one gene deletion, Apiales only contain members of the POR 2 Glade. Three POR 2 isoforms from Thapsia garganica L., Apiaceae, were all full-length in an lllumina root transcriptome dataset (available from the SRA at NCBI). All three genes were shown to be functional upon reconstitution into nanodiscs, confirming that none of the isoforms are pseudogenes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Considering that plant-parasitic nematodes strongly contribute to the decrease in plant growth production, a survey was conducted in the Argan Biosphere in order to assess nematode diversity and distribution. It was established that the parasitic nematofauna was rich, with 70 species belonging to 34 genera and 12 families. Species with high plant decay potential belonging to Longidoridae, Heteroderidae, Hoplolaimidae, Meloidogynidae, Paratylenchidae and Pratylenchidae are present in the argan forest. Telotylenchus sp., Paratylenchus microdorus and Paratylenchus veruculatus, Xiphinema italiae and Xiphinema pachtaicum (virus-transmitting nematodes), and Helicotylenchus crassatus are the most dominant species. Populations of root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) nematodes are also present. Climate forces have driven the structuration of the argan forest to topoclimatic landscapes that led the diversity of the plant-parasitic nematodes communities. The north-south typology of the arid climate affects the richness and the taxonomic and functional diversity of nematodes, while the west-east temperature typology mainly affects the abundance of nematodes, especially of colonizing species. The emergence of plant-parasitic nematode problems as a consequence of intensive agroforestry or argan orchard development is considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We coupled zymography with quantitative measurements of enzyme kinetics to characterize catalytic mechanisms of beta-glucosidase activity at the plant-soil interface including root surface (rhizoplane), rhizosphere, and bulk soil. Direct zymography refined and focused image resolution. The area of hotspots (i.e., spots with most intensive enzyme activity) as well as color intensity ratios estimated using direct zymography exceeded by a factor of 2 the corresponding values obtained with gel zymography. As determined by direct zymography, the percentage of hotspots associated to root surfaces was 58-68 % of total hotspot area. Hotspot area comprised only 6.8 +/- 0.1 % of the total area of an image and 9.0 +/- 3 % of the root surface area. The intensity of beta-glucosidase activity, however, was up to 20 times higher in the hotspots versus bulk soil. The contribution of rhizosphere to beta-glucosidase activity of the whole image (77-82 %) was four times higher than the contribution of the root surface. Enzyme kinetic parameters indicated different enzyme systems in bulk and rhizosphere soil. Higher substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency in bulk than in rhizosphere soil suggested relative domination of microorganisms with more efficient enzyme systems in the former. Coupling direct zymography and kinetic assays enabled mapping the two-dimensional (2D) distribution of enzyme activity at the root-soil interface and estimating the catalytic properties of root-associated and soil-associated enzymes.","[Sanaullah, Muhammad; Razavi, Bahar S.; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia; Kuzyakov, Yakov] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Soil Sci, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Sanaullah, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Soil & Environm Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Blagodatskaya, Evgenia] Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia; [Kuzyakov, Yakov] Kazan Fed Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Kazan, Russia","Sanaullah, M; Blagodatskaya, E (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Soil Sci, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.; Sanaullah, M (reprint author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Soil & Environm Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan.; Blagodatskaya, E (reprint author), Inst Physicochem & Biol Problems Soil Sci, Pushchino 142290, Russia.",sanasial@gmail.com; janeblag@mail.ru,"Razavi, Bahar S./S-7262-2017; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/L-7177-2017","Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Razavi, Bahar S./0000-0002-3726-8268; Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/0000-0002-8284-4017","Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Russian Scientific FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00625]; German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Research Unit ""Carbon flux through the soil animal food web"" [FOR 918, KU1184/3-2]","We acknowledge the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for financial support of MS and the DAAD for BSR.

We experimentally restored available calcium (Ca) to soils of a forested watershed at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, and measured the response of fine root biomass 14 years after treatment. In this northern hardwood forest, fine root (<1 mm diameter) biomass declined significantly in response to the Ca-addition treatment relative to pretreatment and reference forest conditions. The decline was greatest in the mid-and high-elevation hardwood zones of the watershed, where soils are thinnest and have the lowest base saturation and exchangeable Ca pools. Restoration of soil Ca appears to have reduced the allocation of carbon (C) to root systems, coincident with observed increases in aboveground biomass and productivity. Therefore, we suggest that relatively higher tree C allocation to roots in the past contributed to the depressed aboveground productivity observed in northern hardwood forest ecosystems impacted by acid deposition.","[Fahey, Timothy J.; Heinz, Alexis K.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Battles, John J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management ESPM, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fisk, Melany C.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Driscoll, Charles T.; Johnson, Chris E.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Link Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Blum, Joel D.] Univ Michigan, LSA Earth & Environm Sci, 2534 CC Little, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Fahey, TJ (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjf5@cornell.edu,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Johnson, Chris E/A-6979-2011; Battles, John/G-8233-2012","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Johnson, Chris E/0000-0001-9079-813X; Battles, John/0000-0001-7124-7893; Fisk, Melany/0000-0003-4248-0180",National Science Foundation through the LTER Program [1114804]; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [9726837],"The authors thank Jena Ferrarese, Cindy Wood, Natalie Cleavitt, and several undergraduate assistants for their contribution to this research.

Our objectives were to determine: (1) changes in plant traits at the species level; and (2) differences in light-demanding and shade-tolerant species in response to altered light environment. We found that all seedlings of liana species increased in total biomass, total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), height, basal diameter, root length, leaf number, root mass/total plant mass (RMR) and root-to-shoot dry biomass (R/S ratio), and decreased in leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, stem mass-to-total plant mass ratio (SMR) and leaf mass-to-total plant mass ratio (LMR) with increasing light availability. Under the three light environments, the two types of species differed significantly in total biomass, total leaf area, RGR, NAR, LAR, SLA and leaf number, and not in leaf area. Only light-demanding species differed significantly in height, root length, basal diameter, RMR, SMR, LMR and R/S ratio. The mean plasticity index of growth and biomass allocation were relatively higher than the morphological variables, with significant differences between the two groups. Our results showed that liana species respond differently to changing light environments and that light-demanding species exhibit higher plasticity. Such differences may affect the relative success of liana species in forest dynamics.","[Yuan, Chun-ming; Wu, Tao; Geng, Yun-fen; Hao, Jia-bo] State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Conservat Rare Endangered & Endem Forest, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Chun-ming; Wu, Tao; Geng, Yun-fen; Hao, Jia-bo] Yunnan Prov Key Lab Cultivat & Utilizat Forest Pl, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Chun-ming; Wu, Tao; Geng, Yun-fen; Chai, Yong; Hao, Jia-bo] Yunnan Acad Forestry, 2 Lanan Rd, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Yuan, CM (reprint author), Yunnan Acad Forestry, 2 Lanan Rd, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",yuanchunming1017@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation in ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31160136],"We would like to thank the Ailao Mountains Subtropical Forest Ecosystem Research Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for providing the logistics and facility management support.

One of the first stages of forest encroachment is the establishment of tree seedlings at the forest-savanna transition. This study examines the demographic bottleneck in the seedlings of five species of tropical forest pioneer trees in a forest-savanna transition zone in West Africa. Five species of tropical pioneer forest tree seedlings were planted in savanna, mixed/transition, and forest vegetation types and grown for 12 months, during which time fire occurred in the area. We examined seedling survival rates, height, and stem diameter before and after fire; and seedling biomass and starch allocation patterns after fire. Seedling survival rates were significantly affected by fire, drought, and vegetation type. Seedlings that preferentially allocated more resources to increasing root and leaf starch (starch storage helps recovery from fire) survived better in savanna environments (frequently burnt), while seedlings that allocated more resources to growth and resource-capture traits (height, the number of leaves, stem diameter, specific leaf area, specific root length, root-to-shoot ratio) survived better in mixed/transition and forest environments. Larger (taller with a greater stem diameter) seedlings survived burning better than smaller seedlings. However, larger seedlings survived better than smaller ones even in the absence of fire. Bombax buonopozense was the forest species that survived best in the savanna environment, likely as a result of increased access to light allowing greater investment in belowground starch storage capacity and therefore a greater ability to cope with fire. Synthesis: Forest pioneer tree species survived best through fire and drought in the savanna compared to the other two vegetation types. This was likely a result of the open-canopied savanna providing greater access to light, thereby releasing seedlings from light limitation and enabling them to make and store more starch. Fire can be used as a management tool for controlling forest encroachment into savanna as it significantly affects seedling survival. However, if rainfall increases as a result of global change factors, encroachment may be more difficult to control as seedling survival ostensibly increases when the pressure of drought is lifted. We propose B. buonopozense as an indicator species for forest encroachment into savanna in West African forest-savanna transitions.","[Cardoso, Anabelle W.; Malhi, Yadvinder; Oliveras, Immaculada] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Medina-Vega, Jose A.; Veenendaal, Elmar; Oliveras, Immaculada] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Medina-Vega, Jose A.; van Langevelde, Frank] Wageningen Univ, Resource Ecol Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Adu-Bredu, Stephen; Ametsitsi, George K.

The effectiveness of grazing exclusion on sequestering soil organic carbon, increasing total nitrogen and improving soil biological activity has been documented in literature. Few studies, however, have examined the responses of phosphorus (P) fractions and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity to long-term grazing exclusion. In this study, the variations of soil chemical properties, the status of inorganic and organic P fractions in the rhizosphere soil, and the AMF diversity in roots of Leymus chinensis, Stipa krylovii and Cleistogenes squarrosa and in bulk soils were investigated in continuously grazed and ungrazed paddocks (exclusion from grazing for 1012 years) on typical and meadow steppes in Inner Mongolia, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of grazing exclusion in improving AMF diversity and soil P status. Grazing exclusion altered plant species compositions and increased aboveground biomass and ground cover, resulting in increased concentrations of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. The concentration of total phosphorus increased in typical steppes but reduced in meadow steppes, while the concentrations of available P and most P fractions remained unchanged or reduced following 10-12 years of grazing exclusion. Grazing exclusion improved AMF colonization in meadow steppes, but not in typical steppes, attributing to the differences in soil quality, plant species, and AMF phylotypes between two types of steppes. AMF diversity was positively correlated with soil pH, concentrations of soil total nitrogen, total organic carbon, total P, Ca-10-P, medium labile organic P, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase, indicating that, on semi-arid steppes in northern China, improved soil conditions would increase the AMF diversity, thus enhancing the productivity of the steppe ecosystem. However, changes of soil AMF phylotypes due to overgrazing would be detrimental to this fragile ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Along a precipitation regime gradient containing 12 mature seasonally dry tropical forests growing under otherwise similar conditions (similar annual temperature, rainfall seasonality, and geological substrate), we analyzed the influence of variation in annual precipitation (1240 to 642mm) and duration of seasonal drought on soil C. We investigated litterfall, decomposition in the forest floor, and C storage in the mineral soil, and analyzed the dependence of these processes and pools on precipitation. Litterfall decreased slightly - about 10% - from stands with 1240mm yr(-1) to those with 642mm yr(-1), while the decomposition decreased by 56%. Reduced precipitation strongly affected C storage and basal respiration in the mineral soil. Higher soil C storage at the drier sites was also related to the higher chemical recalcitrance of litter (fine roots and forest floor) and the presence of charcoal across sites, suggesting an important indirect influence of climate on C sequestration. Basal respiration was controlled by the amount of recalcitrant organic matter in the mineral soil. We conclude that in these forest ecosystems, the long-term consequences of decreased precipitation would be an increase in organic layer and mineral soil C storage, mainly due to lower decomposition and higher chemical recalcitrance of organic matter, resulting from changes in litter composition and, likely also, wildfire patterns. This could turn these seasonally dry tropical forests into significant soil C sinks under the predicted longer drought periods if primary productivity is maintained.","[Campo, Julio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, AP 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Merino, Agustin] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Escuela Politecn Super Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Lugo 27002, Spain","Campo, J (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, AP 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",jcampo@ecologia.unam.mx,,"Merino, Agustin/0000-0003-3866-7006",PAPIIT-UNAMPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [22610]; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [154754],"This work was supported by PAPIIT-UNAM (Grant-22610) and CONACYT (Grant-154754).

The spatial distribution of plants, which is often generated by patterns of seed recruitment, is an important determinant of population dynamics, especially for orchids with seeds that must be exposed to appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. 2. We compared the distribution and abundance of target mycorrhizal fungi detected in the soil using DNA-based molecular techniques and germination in seed packets of Goodyera pubescens, Liparis liliifolia and Tipularia discolor. 3. We further examined Tulasnella spp. associated with G. pubescens to determine whether areas with abundant host fungi resulted from multiple genets of the same species or from a single widespread fungal genet. 4. We found that target fungi were more likely to be detected using soil DNA assays than by seed germination. Based on soil DNA, fungi were more widespread than suggested by seed germination, which most often reflected the presence of abundant mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. Fungi were more likely to be abundant close to established orchids. Established plants of G. pubescens that were < 50 cm apart associated with a single abundant fungal genet, while those > 50 cm apart associated with multiple fungal genets. 5. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the importance of using multiple methods to detect the distribution and abundance of target fungi and suggests that fungal 'hot spots' may be keys to the dynamics of orchid populations.","[McCormick, Melissa K.; Whigham, Dennis F.; Burnett, Robert K., Jr.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Taylor, D.

Materials and methods A laboratory incubation experiment with and without litter addition was conducted for 80 days at two temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C), two wetting intensities (35 and 50 % water-filled porosity space (WFPS)) and two doses of N addition (0 and 4.5 g N m(-2), as NH4NO3). The tree leaf litters included three types of broadleaf litters, a needle litter, and a mixed litter of them. Soil microbial respiration, microbial biomass, and qCO(2) along with other soil properties were measured at two decomposition stages of tree leaf litters. Results and discussion The increase in soil cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and microbial biomass during the incubation depended on types of tree leaf litters, N addition, and hydrothermal conditions. Soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and N and qCO(2) were significantly greater in all litter-amended than in non-amended soils. However, the difference in the qCO(2) became smaller during the late period of incubation, especially at 25 degrees C. The interactive effect of temperature with soil moisture and N addition was significant for affecting the cumulative litter-derived CO2-C flux at the early and late stages of litter decomposition. Furthermore, the interactive effect of soil moisture and N addition was significant for affecting the cumulative CO2 flux at the late stage of litter decomposition but not early in the experiment. Conclusions This present study indicated that the effects of addition of N and hydrothermal conditions on soil microbial respiration, qCO(2), and concentrations of labile C and N depended on types of tree leaf litters and the development of litter decomposition. The results highlight the importance of N availability and hydrothermal conditions in interactively regulating soil microbial respiration and microbial C utilization during litter decomposition under forest ecosystems.","[Xu, Xingkai; Yin, Lian; Duan, Cuntao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Yin, Lian; Jing, Yuanshu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Xu, XK (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xingkai_xu@mail.iap.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41175133, 41275166, 41321064, 41575154]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41175133, 41275166, 41321064, and 41575154).

The use of mt genes in phylogenetic studies of Dikarya has been met with success, while early diverging fungal lineages remain less studied, particularly the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Advances in next-generation sequencing have substantially increased the number of publically available mtDNA sequences for the Glomeromycota. As a result, comparison of mtDNA across key AMF taxa can now be applied to assess the phylogenetic signal of individual mt coding genes, as well as concatenated subsets of coding genes. Here we show comparative analyses of publically available mt genomes of Glomeromycota, augmented with two mtDNA genomes that were newly sequenced for this study (Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM240159 and Glomus aggregatum DAOM240163), resulting in 16 complete mtDNA datasets. R. irregularis isolate DAOM240159 and G. aggregatum isolate DAOM240163 showed mt genomes measuring 72,293 bp and 69,505 bp with G + C contents of 37.1% and 37.3%, respectively. We assessed the phylogenies inferred from single mt genes and complete sets of coding genes, which are referred to as ""supergenes"" (16 concatenated coding genes), using Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests, in order to identify genes that best described AMF phylogeny. We found that rnl, nad5, cox1, and nad2 genes, as well as concatenated subset of these genes, provided phylogenies that were similar to the supergene set. This mitochondrial genomic analysis was also combined with principal coordinate and partitioning analyses, which helped to unravel certain evolutionary relationships in the Rhizophagus genus and for G. aggregatum within the Glomeromycota. We showed evidence to support the position of G. aggregatum within the R. irregularis 'species complex'. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For the first time, we examined whether trait relatedness across germination and seedling stages allows the identification of general recruitment strategies which share core functional attributes and also correspond to recruitment outcomes in applied settings. We measured six seed and eight seedling traits (lab- and field-collected, respectively) for 47 varieties of dryland grasses and used principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis to identify major dimensions of trait variation and to isolate trait-based recruitment groups, respectively. PCA highlighted some links between seed and seedling traits, suggesting that relative growth rate and root elongation rate are simultaneously but independently associated with seed mass and initial root mass (first axis), and with leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, coleoptile tissue density and germination rate (second axis). Third and fourth axes captured separate tradeoffs between hydrothermal time and base water potential for germination, and between specific root length and root mass ratio, respectively. Cluster analysis separated six recruitment types along dimensions of germination and growth rates, but classifications did not correspond to patterns of germination, emergence or recruitment in the field under either of two watering treatments. Thus, while we have begun to identify major threads of functional variation across seed and seedling stages, our understanding of how this variation influences demographic processes-particularly germination and emergence-remains a key gap in functional ecology.","[Larson, Julie E.] Oregon State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Sheley, Roger L.] USDA ARS, Burns, OR 97720 USA; [Hardegree, Stuart P.] USDA ARS, Boise, ID 83712 USA; [Doescher, Paul S.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [James, Jeremy J.] Univ Calif Browns Valley, Div Agr & Nat Resources, Sierra Foothills Res & Extens Ctr, Browns Valley, CA 95918 USA; [Larson, Julie E.] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA","Larson, JE (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.; Larson, JE (reprint author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",jlarson@chapman.edu,,"Larson, Julie/0000-0001-7968-916X",USDA-Agricultural Research Service Area-wide Ecologically-based Invasive Plant Management of Annual Grasses program,This study was funded as part of the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Area-wide Ecologically-based Invasive Plant Management of Annual Grasses program.,,71,13,14,3,82,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2016,181,1,,,,,39,53,,10.1007/s00442-015-3430-3,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DJ9WM,WOS:000374564000004,26337610,,,,10/31/19J,"Trammell, TLE; Pataki, DE; Cavender-Bares, J; Groffman, PM; Hall, SJ; Heffernan, JB; Hobbie, SE; Morse, JL; Neill, C; Nelson, KC",,,,"Trammell, T.

In residential land cover, private yards are influenced by individual homeowner preferences and actions while also experiencing large-scale human and biophysical drivers. We studied plant nitrogen (%N) and N stable isotopic composition (delta N-15) in residential yards and paired native ecosystems in seven cities across the US that span major ecological biomes and climatic regions: Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City. We found that residential lawns in three cities had enriched plant delta N-15 (P < 0.03) and in six cities higher plant N (%) relative to the associated native ecosystems (P < 0.05). Plant delta N-15 was progressively depleted across a gradient of urban density classes in Baltimore and Boston (P < 0.05). Lawn fertilization was associated with depleted plant delta N-15 in Boston and Los Angeles (P < 0.05), and organic fertilizer additions were associated with enriched plant delta N-15 in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City (P < 0.04). Plant delta N-15 was significantly enriched as a function of housing age in Baltimore (r (2) = 0.27, P < 0.02), Boston (r (2) = 0.27, P < 0.01), and Los Angeles (r (2) = 0.34, P < 0.01). These patterns in plant delta N-15 and plant N (%) across these cities suggests that N sources to lawns, as well as greater rates of N cycling combined with subsequent N losses, may be important drivers of plant N dynamics in lawn ecosystems at the national scale.","[Trammell, T.

We aimed to disentangle the effects of tree species and die-off state on litter decomposition in a mixed forest where Pinus sylvestris populations experiencing severe drought-induced die-off are being replaced by Quercus ilex. Litter bags with leaves and fine roots from both species were placed under canopies representing three habitats of the die-off and replacement process (healthy and dead P. sylvestris and healthy Q. ilex). Mass was assessed over 3 years. Species-specific chemistry of litter (C:N ratio) had a direct effect on mass loss, but also indirect effects, attributed to the decomposer microbial community associated with a given habitat-species. In their respective original habitats, oak leaves decomposed 44 % faster than pine needles, whereas oak roots decomposed 46 % slower than pine roots. Forest die-off and species replacement affected litter decomposition. This effect can have great implications in forest functioning, particularly if drought-induced die-off worsens in the next decades, according with the trend observed in the studied system.","[Barba, Josep; Lloret, Francisco] CREAF, Cerdanyola Valles, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Barba, Josep; Lloret, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Curiel Yuste, Jorge] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Barba, J (reprint author), CREAF, Cerdanyola Valles, Barcelona 08193, Catalonia, Spain.; Barba, J (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, E-08193 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",j.barba@creaf.uab.cat,"Lloret, Francisco/H-2711-2015; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/A-6438-2011","Lloret, Francisco/0000-0002-9836-4069; Curiel Yuste, Jorge/0000-0002-3221-6960; Barba, Josep/0000-0001-9094-9516","Spanish GovernmentSpanish Government [CGL2009-08101, CGL2010-16373, CGL2012-32965, CGL2013-42271-P]; Government of CataloniaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2009-SGR-00247, 2014-SGR-453]; TRY initiative on plant traits; FPI scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2010-036558]; ""Ramon y Cajal"" programmeMinistry of Education and Science, Spain","The authors thank I.

Therefore, we selected fenced communities and grazed communities to study the effects of grazing exclusion on desert grassland on the Loess Plateau in China. Our results indicate that plant coverage, plant height, richness index, above- and below-ground biomass, root/shoot ratio, the number of grasses and the number of perennials increased significantly, whereas litter biomass, the number of forbs and annuals significantly decreased after approximately 12 years of fencing. Fencing also resulted in marked increases in ammonium nitrogen (AN) in the 0-10 cm soil depth, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NN), clay and silt in the 0-30 cm soil depth and soil total phosphorus (TP) in 0-100 cm soil depth. Our results also indicated that SOC, TN, NN, clay, silt, sand and belowground biomass were significantly affected by land use type, soil layer and their interaction between land use type and soil layer. However, AN was affected by only land use type, and TP was affected by land use type and soil layer but not their interaction. In addition, there was s significant correlation between soil chemical properties (SOC, TN, TP, NN, AN) and soil particles (silt, clay and sand) in the 0-5 cm soil depth.

Host control models posit that legume hosts act as a predominant selective force on rhizobia, but few studies have examined rhizobial fitness in natural populations. Here, we genotyped and phenotyped Bradyrhizobium isolates across more than 800 km of the native Acmispon strigosus host range. We sequenced chromosomal genes expressed under free-living conditions and accessory symbiosis loci expressed in planta and encoded on an integrated 'symbiosis island' (SI). We uncovered a massive clonal expansion restricted to the Bradyrhizobium chromosome, with a single chromosomal haplotype dominating populations, ranging more than 700 km, and acquiring 42 divergent SI haplotypes, none of which were spatially widespread. For focal genotypes, we quantified utilization of 190 sole-carbon sources relevant to soil fitness. Chromosomal haplotypes that were both widespread and dominant exhibited superior growth on diverse carbon sources, whereas these patterns were not mirrored among SI haplotypes. Abundance, spatial range and catabolic superiority of chromosomal, but not symbiosis genotypes suggests that fitness in the soil environment, rather than symbiosis with hosts, might be the key driver of Bradyrhizobium dominance.","[Hollowell, Amanda C.; Regus, John U.; Gano-Cohen, Kelsey A.; Bantay, Roxanne; Bernardo, Andrew; Moore, Devora; Pham, Jonathan; Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Sachs, Joel L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Turissini, David] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.; Sachs, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Inst Integrat Genome Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",joels@ucr.edu,"Sachs, Joel/AAB-9348-2019","Sachs, Joel/0000-0002-0221-9247","Herbert Kraft Scholarship; UC Riverside Graduate Research Mentorship Fellowship; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0816663, DEB 1150278]","The following grants supported this study: to A.C.H. a Herbert Kraft Scholarship and a UC Riverside Graduate Research Mentorship Fellowship, and to J.L.S.

Several disturbance activities in tropical forests have reduced the biomass and net primary production (NPP) leading to climate change. Therefore, an accurate estimation of forest biomass and C cycling in context of disturbances is required for implementing REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) policy. Methods: Biomass and NPP of trees and shrubs were estimated by using allometric equations while herbaceous biomass was estimated by harvest method. Fine root biomass was determined from soil monolith. The C stock in vegetation was calculated by multiplying C concentration to dry weight. Results: Total stand biomass (Mg.ha(-1)) in undisturbed forest stand (US) was 960.4 while in disturbed forest stand (DS) it was 449.1. The biomass (Mg.ha(-1)) of trees, shrubs and herbs in US was 948.0, 4.4 and 1.4, respectively, while in DS they were 438.4, 6.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total NPP (Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) was 26.58 (equivalent to 12.26 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)) in US and 14.91 (6.88 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)) in DS. Total C input into soil through litter plus root turnover was 6.78 and 3.35 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) in US and DS, respectively. Conclusions: Several disturbance activities resulted in the significant loss in stand biomass (53 %), NPP (44 %), and C sequestration capacity of tropical forest in eastern Nepal. The net uptake of carbon by the vegetation is far greater than that returned to the soil by the turnover of fine root and litter. Therefore, both stands of present forest act as carbon accumulating systems. Moreover, disturbance reflects higher C emissions which can be reduced by better management.","[Gautam, Tilak Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Bot, Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus, Biratnagar, Nepal; [Mandal, Tej Narayan] Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Bot, Post Grad Campus, Biratnagar, Nepal","Gautam, TP (reprint author), Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Bot, Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus, Biratnagar, Nepal.",tilakg024@gmail.com,,,,,,36,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6355,2197-5620,,FOR ECOSYST,For.

However, functional relationships between inundation and productivity are poorly characterized for most species. Determining species-specific tolerances to inundation is necessary to evaluate sea-level rise (SLR) effects on future marsh plant community composition, quantify organic matter inputs to marsh accretion, and inform predictive modeling of tidal wetland persistence. In 2 macrotidal estuaries in the northeast Pacific we grew 5 common species in experimental mesocosms across a gradient of tidal elevations to assess effects on growth. We also tested whether species abundance distributions along elevation gradients in adjacent marshes matched productivity profiles in the mesocosms. We found parabolic relationships between inundation and total plant biomass and shoot counts in Spartina foliosa and Bolboschoenus maritimus in California, USA, and in Carex lyngbyei in Oregon, USA, with maximum total plant biomass occurring at 38, 28, and 15% time submerged, respectively. However, biomass of Salicornia pacifica and Juncus balticus declined monotonically with increasing inundation. Inundation effects on the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass varied inconsistently among species. In comparisons of field distributions with mesocosm results, B. maritimus, C. lyngbyei and J. balticus were abundant in marshes at or above elevations corresponding with their maximum productivity; however, S. foliosa and S. pacifica were frequently abundant at lower elevations corresponding with sub-optimal productivity. Our findings show species-level differences in how marsh plant growth may respond to future SLR and highlight the sensitivity of high marsh species such as S. pacifica and J. balticus to increases in flooding.","[Janousek, Christopher N.; Buffington, Kevin J.; Dugger, Bruce D.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Janousek, Christopher N.; Buffington, Kevin J.; Thorne, Karen M.; Takekawa, John Y.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA; [Guntenspergen, Glenn R.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Laurel, MD 20708 USA; [Takekawa, John Y.] Natl Audubon Soc, Div Sci, 220 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA","Janousek, CN (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Janousek, CN (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Vallejo, CA 94592 USA.",janousec@onid.oregonstate.edu,,,Southwest and Northwest Climate Science Center (SWCSC) of the US Department of the Interior; Southwest and Northwest Climate Science Center (NWCSC) of the US Department of the Interior; DOI On The Landscape program; USGS Climate and Land-Use Research and Development Program; USGS Western Ecological Research Center in partnership; Oregon State University; NWCSC graduate fellowship,"The project described in this publication was supported by the Southwest and Northwest Climate Science Centers (SWCSC and NWCSC) of the US Department of the Interior, the DOI On The Landscape program, the USGS Climate and Land-Use Research and Development Program, the USGS Western Ecological Research Center in partnership with Oregon State University and a NWCSC graduate fellowship to K.J.B.

However, little is known about the response of R-s to forest thinning in the subalpine region and its linkage to changes in environmental factors induced by thinning. We aimed to quantify the response of R-s rate to various gap sizes following thinning treatments, and to explore the relationships between Rs and soil temperature and moisture and other biophysical factors in the different gap sizes. We applied the thinning by simulating gap formation (four gap sizes at 0, 74, 109 and 196 m(2)) in a 26-year old spruce plantation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We measured R-s monthly before (July to November 2008) and after (December 2008 to June 2012) thinning, as well as monthly soil temperature and moisture and other biophysical factors. Thinning tended to decrease fine root biomass, litterfall, soil extractable C, and increased soil temperature and soil moisture. The change in soil temperature and moisture depended on the time after thinning and the size of forest gap. We found that R-s showed an immediate decrease in initial stage after thinning, followed by a gradual increase with understory development towards the level at the control plot. Overall, thinning decreased R-s rate by 14.9%, 15.8% and 25.8% in the small, intermediate and large gap, respectively, as compared to the control. We concluded that the decrease in Rs rates by thinning in a spruce plantation was driven by the decline in tree root biomass and reduction in soil labile C. The positive effect of soil temperature elevation under thinning on Rs was masked by other factors, and the development of understory vegetation after thinning gradually offset the thinning-induced R-s reduction.

We studied fifty five 200 m(2)-plots in a P. halepensis plantation in NE Spain, 23 on soils with gypsum and 32 on soils without gypsum. Trees were measured to estimate site index at age 40 years (SI40). A soil pit was described in each plot to a depth of 1 m or to a root-limiting layer, and samples of the various horizons analysed for pH, organic carbon (C), total nitrogen, Olsen phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (extracted with NH4OAc), calcium carbonate (calcimeter method), and gypsum concentration (Artieda method), and texture. We studied root development in the soil horizons of 15 of these plots by counting root numbers at depths of 0-30 cm, 30-55 cm, and 55-80 cm in three 100 cm(2)-squares per depth. Penetration resistance and bulk density were also measured in these horizons. Soils with gypsum were frequently less than 25 cm deep, and had negligible concentrations of Olsen phosphorus. Values of SI40, with a maximum of 15.5 m, were primarily determined, in all types of soils, by a positive effect of soil rootable depth, indicating the dominant influence of water availability, and to a lesser extent by the negative effect of the C/P ratio and rock fragment content in the upper 30 cm of soil. Density of fine and very fine roots decreased in deeper soil horizons from a maximum value of 97 roots . dm(-2) in the surface horizons. Mechanical impedance by increased penetration resistance was the main limitation for root development. Soil gypsum does not have a direct influence on growth but constrains the volume of soil that may be explored by roots. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the potential for the removal of heavy metal Cr(VI) using PMFC was evaluated, and the performance of the PMFC at various initial Cr(VI) contents was investigated. The Cr(VI) removal efficiency could reached 99% under various conditions. Both the Cr(VI) removal rates and the removal efficiencies increased with the increasing initial Cr(VI) concentration. Furthermore, the long-term operation of the PMFC indicated that the system was stable and sustainable for Cr(VI) removal. The mass balance results and XPS analysis results demonstrate that only a small amount of soluble Cr(III) remained in the PMFC and that most Cr(III) precipitated in the form of the Cr(OH)(3(s)) or was adsorbed onto the electrodes. The PMFC experiments of without acetate addition also show that plants can provide carbon source for MFC through secrete root exudates and bioelectrochemical reduction of Cr(VI) was the main mechanism for the Cr(VI) removal.

The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. Seedlings were separately inoculated with the suspension of two rhizobial strains and grown under two irrigation regimes: 80% of field capacity (optimal irrigation) and 40% of field capacity (water deficit). The water stress was applied for five weeks and the agro-physiological and biochemical parameters related to water deficit tolerance were assessed. The results showed that the water deficit had significantly reduced the height of the plants, the dry biomass and nodulation. This constraint also negatively affected the relative water content of leaves, the membrane permeability, the stomatal conductance, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, the time to reach maximum fluorescence, the total chlorophyll content and the total nitrogen content. Comparison among the tested symbiotic combinations showed that their behaviors were significantly different. Under drought, oasis populations Ad and Ta maintained high PS II efficiency, membrane stability, relative water content, chlorophyll and nitrogen content in comparison to the mountain one Dm2 and the American Moapa variety.

We labeled intact roots by brief N-15 exposures in field hydroponic experiments. Nine dominant tree species were examined to compare the effects of functional plant group (conifers versus broadleaves), mycorrhizal types, and forest successional stages on N uptake. All investigated species took up glycine at lower rates than other N forms, with mean values of 2.55 +/- 0.36 mu g N g(-1) d.w. root h(-1). Nitrate uptake rates for all species (average 5.81 +/- 0.35 mu g N g(-1) d.w. root h(-1)) were significantly lower than ammonium (36.86 +/- 5.17 mu g N g(-1) d. w. root h(-1)). All investigated species absorbed ammonium for more than 80% of total N uptake. Nitrate acquisition by these species was about 14% of total N uptake, with only 6% for glycine. Conifers showed significantly higher uptake rates of glycine, but lower uptake of nitrate than broadleaves. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species showed significant difference in nitrate uptake, with higher rates by AM tree species. Tree species at late-successional forest stages showed higher uptake rates of nitrate than those in earlier successional stages. Our findings indicate that ammonium is the dominant N source and glycine is a minor N source throughout forest succession.","[Li, Changcheng; Li, Qianru; Xu, Xingliang; Li, Qingkang; Wang, Huimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosystem Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Changcheng; Li, Qianru] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Na] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, 88 Xuefu Rd, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Xu, XL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosystem Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",xuxingl@hotmail.com,"Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015","Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB 416903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31130009, 4107 1209]; Knowledge Innovation Foundation Program for Outstanding Young Scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-QN302]",This study was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB 416903) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31130009 and 4107 1209) the Knowledge Innovation Foundation Program for Outstanding Young Scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-QN302).,,43,6,11,0,23,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,APR,2016,9,,,,,,253,258,,10.3832/ifor1502-008,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,DO9NR,WOS:000378113800001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Katanic, M; Grebenc, T; Orlovic, S; Matavuly, M; Kovacevic, B; Bajc, M; Kraigher, H",,,,"Katanic, Marina; Grebenc, Tine; Orlovic, Sasa; Matavuly, Milan; Kovacevic, Branislav; Bajc, Marko; Kraigher, Hojka",,,Ectomycorrhizal fungal community associated with autochthonous white poplar from Serbia,IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ectomycorrhiza; Populus alba; Diversity; Nature Reserve; Seasonal Dynamics; Morphological-Anatomical Characterization; Molecular Identification,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; NORWAY SPRUCE; FOREST; DIVERSITY; L.; IDENTIFICATION; DYNAMICS; SLOVENIA; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS,"We analyzed the community of ectomycorrhizal fungi of an autochthonous white poplar (Populus alba L.) stand in the Kovilj-Petrovaradin marshes (Serbia), and examined its seasonal dynamics.

Results show that arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was greater than 60% for Mimosa species, and up to 26% for Parapiptadenia. Overall, the fungal inoculation promoted better plant growth, with increments of up to 1430%. Phosphorous absorption was favored, especially when inoculation was done with A. colombiana, R. irregularis and A. morrowiae. Even though there was a conclusive reduction in the levels of trace elements in the plant's shoots, the inoculation with those species of fungi promoted significant increments in the accumulated levels of As, Cu, Zn and Cr for all plant species tested.

This study developed a new method to estimate fine-root production by considering the difference in the production of fine roots of two size classes, fine roots thinner than 1 mm and those between 1 and 2 mm, and their corresponding rates of decomposition. A litter bag experiment was used to estimate the decomposition rates, while the sequential soil core technique was used to identify mass values of live roots and dead roots at a given period of observation. The continuous inflow method was applied to estimate the amount of root decomposition, mortality and production with a framework of two diameter classes of fine roots and for quantification of the amount of mass transfer from the thicker fine-root class to the coarser root category (>2 mm). The results indicated that the estimate of fine-root production was greater when two size classes of fine roots were distinguished. Using a framework of two size classes developed in this study resulted in 21.3% higher fine-root production than a method that did not recognize fine-root size classes or mass transfer to the category of coarse roots. In addition, using shorter collection intervals led to higher production estimates than longer intervals. The production estimate with a 1-month interval was 21.4% higher than that with a 6-month interval. We consider that the use of the sequential soil core technique with continuous inflow estimate method by differentiating size classes of fine roots is likely to minimize the underestimation of the parameters of fine-root dynamics by accounting for decomposition and mortality of fine roots more appropriately.","[Van Do, Tran] Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Sivilculture Res Inst, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Van Do, Tran] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Van Do, Tran; Sato, Tamotsu] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Vegetat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Osawa, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Osawa, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Van Do, T (reprint author), Vietnamese Acad Forest Sci, Sivilculture Res Inst, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.; Van Do, T (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.; Van Do, T (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Forest Vegetat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",dotran@cseas.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Van Tran/H-8431-2013; Van, Tran/I-8464-2019","Van, Tran/0000-0001-9059-5842",,,,34,4,4,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,2016,36,4,,,,,513,523,,10.1093/treephys/tpv121,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,DN9MP,WOS:000377404000011,26614784,,,,10/31/19J,"Gadhave, KR; Hourston, JE; Gange, AC",,,,"Gadhave, Kiran R.; Hourston, James E.; Gange, Alan C.",,,Developing Soil Microbial Inoculants for Pest Management: Can One Have Too Much of a Good Thing?,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,,,English,Review,,,,,,Microbial inoculants; Foliar chemistry; Tritrophic interactions; Pest management; Insect herbivores,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; GROWTH-PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; SYSTEMIC RESISTANCE; PLANT VOLATILES; COMMUNITY; RHIZOSPHERE; INSECT; ROOTS; COLONIZATION,"Soil microbes present a novel and cost-effective method of increasing plant resistance to insect pests and thus create a sustainable opportunity to reduce current pesticide application. However, the use of microbes in integrated pest management programs is still in its infancy. This can be attributed primarily to the variations in microbial inoculum performance under laboratory and field conditions. Soil inoculants containing single, indigenous microbial species have shown promising results in increasing chemical defenses of plants against foliar feeding insects. Conversely, commercial inoculants containing multiple species tend to show no effects on herbivore infestation in the field. We present here a simple model that endeavours to explain how single and multiple species in microbial inoculants differentially govern insect population dynamics via changes in plant chemical profiles.

Important novelties are proposed by this tool, including a high temporal resolution (daily time step), a proposal of a new plant classification approach useful for research and management (successional plant functional types), good representation of the key processes that determine the vegetation dynamics in riparian areas (drought and flood impacts, recruitment, growth, succession and competition), an easy implementation and feasible inclusion of river morphodynamics in the model implementation (including different daily elevation and soil maps in the inputs). The model implementation in a Mediterranean semi-arid study site resulted satisfactorily (cell by cell calibration accuracy >= 65% and cell by cell validation accuracy between 40% and 60%), demonstrating the great potential of this approach for future research and management applications. Although 36 parameters are included in the model conceptualization, the global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that only eight types of parameters are actually influent. These parameters are as follows: minimum time since mixed for transition to terrestrial, root depths, transpiration factors, critical shear stress of early stages, minimum biomass required to allow succession, germination minimum capillary water content in the upper soil, effective depth considered for evaporation from bare soil and coverage of pioneers. Riparian vegetation dynamic model will be a useful tool for gaining a better understanding of the riparian plants behaviour under different ecohydrological conditions.

The number of model parameters is reduced using allometric relationships. The model can represent more isohydric (pinon) and more anisohydric (juniper) responses. Analysis of the parameter space suggests four main controls on hydraulic failure and carbon starvation: xylem vulnerability curve, root:shoot area ratio, rooting depth and water use efficiency. For pinon, an intermediate optimal (1.5-2 m(2) m(-2)) tree leaf area index reduces the risk of hydraulic failure. For both pinons and junipers, hydraulic failure was relatively insensitive to root:shoot ratio across a range of tree LAI. Higher root: shoot ratios however strongly decreased the time to carbon starvation. The hydraulic safety margin of pinons is strongly diminished by large diurnal variations in xylem/leaf water potential. Diurnal drops of water potential are mitigated by high maximum hydraulic conductivity, high root:shoot ratio and stomatal regulation (more isohydric). The safety margin of junipers is not very sensitive to diurnal drops in water potential so that there is little benefit in stomatal regulation (more anisohydric). Narrower tracheid diameter and a narrower distribution of tracheid diameters reduce the risk of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation by reducing diurnal xylem water potential drop. Simulated tree diameter-dependent mortality varies between these two species, with pinon mortality decreasing with increasing tree size, whereas juniper mortality increases with tree size. Juvenile pinons might thus be overimpacted by water stress.

The relationship between root (R) and shoot (S) biomass and the root: shoot ratio (R/S) are critical parameters for estimating the terrestrial carbon stocks and biomass allocation mechanism responses to human activities. Previous studies have often used the belowground: aboveground biomass ratio (M-b/M-a) to replace the R/S in alpine ecosystems. However, these studies may have neglected the leaf meristem biomass, which belongs to the shoot but occurs below the soil surface, leading to a significant overestimation of the R/S ratio. We conducted a comparative study to explore the differences between the R/S and M-b/M-a at both the species (Stipa purpurea, Carex moorcroftii, and Artemisia nanschanica) and community levels on a Tibetan alpine grassland with grazing and fencing management blocks. The results revealed that the use of the M-b/M-a to express the R/S appeared to overestimate the actual value of the R/S, both at species and community levels. For S. purpurea, the M-b/M-a was three times higher than the R/S. The M-b/M-a was approximately two times higher than the R/S for the species of C. moorcroftii and A. nanschanica and at the community level. The relationships between the R-S and M-b-M-a exhibited different slopes for the alpine plants across all the management practices. Compared to the fenced grasslands, the plants in the grazing blocks not only allocated more biomass to the roots but also to the leaf meristems. The present study highlights the contribution of leaf meristems to the accurate assessment of shoot and belowground biomasses. The R/S and M-b/M-a should be cautiously used in combination in the future research. The understanding of the distinction between the R-S and M-b-M-a may help to improve the biomass allocation mechanism response to human disturbances in an alpine area.","[Hong, Jiangtao; Ma, Xingxing; Wang, Xiaodan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, 9,Block 4,Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Hong, Jiangtao; Ma, Xingxing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Wang, XD (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, 9,Block 4,Renminnanlu Rd, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",wxd@imde.ac.cn,,,Strategic Leading Science and Technology Projects CAS [XDB03030505]; National Science and Technology support project [2011BAC09B03]; Action-plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [KZCX2-XB3-08],"This research was jointly funded by the Strategic Leading Science and Technology Projects CAS (XDB03030505), the National Science and Technology support project (2011BAC09B03), the Action-plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) for West Development (KZCX2-XB3-08).",,23,1,2,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here, we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to aboveground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, aboveground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary, USA. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important tradeoff with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, aboveground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of belowground biomass as the root : shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation.","[Elmore, Andrew J.; Engelhardt, Katharina A.

However, this may not always be the case. It has been hypothesized that the benefits mycorrhizal fungi convey to their host plants strongly depends upon the availability of C and N, both of which are rapidly changing as a result of intensified human land use and climate change. Using large-scale shading and N addition treatments, we assessed the independent and interactive effects of changes in C and N supply on the transfer of N in intact EM associations with similar to 15 yr. old Scots pine trees. To assess the dynamics of N transfer in EM symbioses, we added trace amounts of highly enriched (NO3-)-N-15 label to the EM-dominated mor-layer and followed the fate of the N-15 label in tree foliage, fungal chitin on EM root tips, and EM sporocarps. Despite no change in leaf biomass, shading resulted in reduced tree C uptake, ca. 40% lower fungal biomass on EM root tips, and greater N-15 label in tree foliage compared to unshaded control plots, where more N-15 label was found in fungal biomass on EM colonized root tips. Short-term addition of N shifted the incorporation of N-15 label from EM fungi to tree foliage, despite no significant changes in below-ground tree C allocation to EM fungi. Contrary to the common assumption that C and N are exchanged at rates favorable for plant growth, our results show for the first time that under N-limited conditions greater C allocation to EM fungi in the field results in reduced, not increased, N transfer to host trees. Moreover, given the ubiquitous nature of mycorrhizal symbioses, our results stress the need to incorporate mycorrhizal dynamics into process-based ecosystem models to better predict forest C and N cycles in light of global climate change.","[Hasselquist, Niles J.; Metcalfe, Daniel B.; Inselsbacher, Erich; Oren, Ram; Nasholm, Torgny; Hogberg, Peter] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Stangl, Zsofia; Nasholm, Torgny] Umea Univ, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, SE-90185 Umea, Sweden; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Environm Sci & Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Inselsbacher, Erich] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Hasselquist, NJ (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",niles.hasselquist@gmail.com,"Hogberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019; Inselsbacher, Erich/C-3727-2012","Hogberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Inselsbacher, Erich/0000-0001-5490-8768; Stangl, Zsofia Reka/0000-0002-0119-747X","VR, FORMAS; Kempe foundation","We thank R.

A meta-analysis of 759 articles (1978-2012) was conducted to test whether ecologically important host plant traits (N fixation and C-fixation pathway) affect the response of the plant to mycorrhizal colonization. We found that the effect of N-fixation on mycorrhizal growth response (MGR) depended on whether the plant was woody or a forb. N-fixing forbs had a higher MGR than non-N-fixing forbs, but the reverse was true for woody plants. Moreover, C4-grasses had significantly higher MGR than Cs-grasses, but no significant difference was found between C3 and C4 forbs, or between C3 and C4 woody species. Overall, woody species had higher MGR than any other functional group. These results demonstrate that MGR does depend on host functional characteristics, but neither N-fixation capacity nor C-fixation pathway are apparently fundamental controllers of MGR. Instead, it would appear possible that these traits influence MGR only insofar as they influence more fundamental functions such as P demand and P supply.

Here, we compared EM communities of adult pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur) between urban and forest environments, and assessed the effect of soil sealing around the trees on their EM community composition and EM diversity. We sampled 32 oak individuals across 4 sampling classes (Street, Lane, Park and Forest), and we characterized their EM communities using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. The EM communities were not nested but they were significantly different between all sampling classes, with a very strong community differentiation between forest and urban trees. There were indications that EM richness declined with increasing sealed soil surface, with a significant effect of sampling class on estimated EM richness and diversity. We also identified indicator EM of the different sampling classes. The most important soil factor affecting EM community composition was pH, followed by plant available phosphorus, total nitrogen content and organic matter. Our results may have important implications when developing EM inocula for managing tree health in urban environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

These interactions are of extreme importance for the diversity of plant communities and ecosystem functioning. Despite this importance, only recently has the structure of plant-AMF interaction networks been studied. These recent studies, which used genetic data, suggest that these networks are highly structured, very similar to plant-animal mutualistic networks. However, the assembly process of plant-AMF communities is still largely unknown, and an important feature of plant-AMF interactions has not been incorporated: they occur at an extremely localized scale. Studying plant-AMF networks in a spatial context seems therefore a crucial step. This paper studies a plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network using novel methodology based on information theory and a unique set of spatially explicit species-level data. We apply three null models of which only one accounts for spatial effects. We find that the data show substantial departures from null expectations for the two non-spatial null models. However, for the null model considering spatial effects, there are few significant co-occurrences compared with the other two null models. Thus, plant-AMF spatial co-occurrences seem to be mostly explained by stochasticity, with a small role for other factors related to plant-AMF specialization. Furthermore, we find that the network is not significantly nested or modular. We conclude that this plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network lacks substantial structure and, therefore, plants and AMF species do not track each other over space. Thus, random encounters seem more important in the first step of the assembly of plant-AMF communities. Synthesis The symbiotic interaction between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is crucial for ecosystem functioning. However, the factors affecting the assembly of plant-AMF communities are poorly understood. An important factor of the assembly of plant-AMF communities has been overlooked: plant-AMF interactions occur at a localized spatial scale. Our study investigated the importance of space in the structure of plant-AMF communities. We studied a plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network using a unique set of spatially explicit data and applied three null models. We found that plant-AMF spatial co-occurrences seem to be mostly explained by stochasticity. In particular, our study shows that this plant-AMF spatial co-occurrence network lacks substantial structure and, therefore, plants and AMF species do not track each other over space. Thus, random encounters seem to drive the assembly of plant-AMF communities.","[Encinas-Viso, Francisco; Alonso, David; Etienne, Rampal S.; Chang, Esther R.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Box 11103, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Encinas-Viso, Francisco] CSIRO, Ctr Australian Natl Biodivers Res, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Alonso, David] CEAB CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes, Theoret Ecol Lab, Barcelona, Spain; [Klironomos, John N.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Biol, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Encinas-Viso, F (reprint author), CSIRO, Ctr Australian Natl Biodivers Res, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",franencinas@gmail.com,"Etienne, Rampal/F-5835-2012; Alonso, David/A-5406-2008","Etienne, Rampal/0000-0003-2142-7612; Alonso, David/0000-0002-8888-1644",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Spanish 'Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad' under the project SITES [CGL2012-39964]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),"R.

Minirhizotron images were used to determine fine root dynamics in a stand and gap in each of the sites for 12 periods during the 2007-2009 growing seasons. The environmental variables included air and soil temperatures, precipitation, forest floor precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil water contents. For data analysis, the daily mean values for each period for all variables were used. Fine root ingrowth and mortality were higher in the managed stand and gap compared to the old-growth stand and gap, but only significantly correlated with each other in the case of the managed stand. Forest floor precipitation and soil temperature were significant in explaining fine root ingrowth, whereas maximal evapotranspiration, soil temperature and soil water content were more important for fine root mortality. However, the correlations were weak and inconsistent among the four sites. By including site as predictor as well as environmental variables, R (2) values of 0.49 and 0.55 for ingrowth and mortality, respectively, were achieved. Despite this, the relationships between the fine root dynamics and selected environmental factors appeared relatively weak and complex, especially for fine root ingrowth and might be partially related also to differences in successional stages of the forests under study.","[Zeleznik, Peter; Vilhar, Ursa; de Groot, Maarten; Kraigher, Hojka] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Starr, Mike] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Zeleznik, P (reprint author), Slovenian Forestry Inst, Vecna Pot 2, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",peter.zeleznik@gozdis.si,,"de Groot, Maarten/0000-0002-5721-6676; Starr, Michael/0000-0001-6678-4854",,,,51,4,4,6,55,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Currently, an assessment of a possible coordination between leaf and root decomposition across different species is required. However, previous studies have generated conflicting results. We hypothesized that such inconsistencies may be attributed to differences in local climatic effects on the decomposition process. We focused on the linkages between leaf and fine-root decomposition of woody species in a warm-temperate forest, which have not been addressed in previous studies. We found a significant positive correlation between leaf and root decomposition, and this linkage may be attributed to a wider range of decomposition rates across the species in our study forest. Additionally, we combined our data with those of previous studies of woody species to infer a global linkage in the decomposition process between leaves and roots. We found a positive correlation in decomposition rates between leaves and roots at the global scale, as well as a relatively strong correlation in warmer regions. These results support the importance of litter quality on biogeochemical processes and suggest that synergetic interactions between climate and plant communities could be amplified in a warmer future.","[Fujii, Saori; Takeda, Hiroshi] Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Kyoto 6100394, Japan; [Fujii, Saori; Mori, Akira S.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Dept Environm & Nat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 6120855, Japan","Fujii, S (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Kyoto 6100394, Japan.; Fujii, S (reprint author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Dept Environm & Nat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",sao@itak.or.jp,"Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013","Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198",,,,50,8,9,1,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

We investigated the biomass, morphology (specific root length; SRL), and respiration rates of fine roots and analyzed the soil nitrogen status in seven Chamaecyparis obtusa stands with two highly contrasting ABC soils. There were no significant differences in the biomass, SRL, and respiration rates of fine roots between high- and low-ABC stands. However, fine roots in the low-ABC stands were concentrated in the uppermost soil layers and the biomass proportion of roots < 0.5 mm in diameter was higher in low-ABC stands than in high-ABC stands. The fine root biomass increased with increasing soil Al, NH4 (+)-N, and C and with decreasing soil BC and bulk density.

In recent decades, Siberian dwarf pine [Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel] has been invading dry heath alpine tundra in the northern Amur region of Far East Russia. Siberian dwarf pine is known to have high aboveground productivity, comparable to that of tall coniferous trees. We hypothesised that the invasion of Siberian dwarf pine into alpine tundra could increase soil carbon stocks via an increase in fine roots. Contrary to our expectations, the invasion of dwarf pine did not significantly increase the fine root biomass and productivity of the tundra, probably due to the belowground competitive exclusion between the dwarf pine and alpine tundra plants. Furthermore, the invasion of the dwarf pine did not affect soil carbon in the alpine tundra ecosystem. These results show that the recent invasion of Siberian dwarf pine into tundra did not influence the fine root dynamics or the soil carbon stock in the study site. Together, these results implied that (1) it takes a long time for pine invasion to change the belowground ecosystem properties of tundra vegetation to that of pine thickets and therefore (2) the lack of an increase in soil carbon from recent tree invasion should be taken into account when modelling future carbon dynamics in alpine tundra.","[Makoto, Kobayashi] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Nakagawa Expt Forest, Otoineppu, Hokkaido 9812501, Japan; [Bryanin, S.

The estimation of the fine root production is important for understanding the mechanisms of carbon cycling in ecosystems. The recently developed net sheet method allows the measurement of fine root production in forest ecosystems. The simplicity of this innovative technique reduces labor costs and causes little soil disturbance during installation. However, the protocols and methods are still poorly developed; for example, the effects of net material, mesh aperture size and firmness on the results remain unknown. Therefore, we measured the number and dry mass of fine roots grown through net sheets in forest soils to determine the effect of the net quality and type (polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, stainless steel), mesh aperture size (2 and 4 mm) and firmness (firm and flexible) on the results. The study was conducted in managed and unmanaged Japanese cedar forests in Japan and in a mixed dipterocarp forest in Malaysia. No effect of net material or mesh aperture size on the number of roots grown through the net sheets or on root production was observed. A smaller number of roots grew through the firm type of nets than that of the flexible nets in the managed Japanese cedar and mixed dipterocarp forests. These results suggest that fine root production is not affected by the material of the net sheets or the mesh aperture size, but flexible nets are preferable to avoid an underestimation of fine root production.","[Ohashi, Mizue; Nakano, Aiko; Ikeno, Hidetoshi; Fukae, Ryohei] Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, 1-1-12 Shinzaike Honcho, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan; [Hirano, Yasuhiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Noguchi, Kyotaro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Yamase, Keitaro] Hyogo Prefectural Technol Ctr Agr Forestry & Fish, Shiso 6712515, Japan; [Makita, Naoki] Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod, Res Inst, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6120855, Japan; [Finer, Leena] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Joensuu 80101, Finland","Ohashi, M (reprint author), Univ Hyogo, Sch Human Sci & Environm, 1-1-12 Shinzaike Honcho, Himeji, Hyogo 6700092, Japan.",ohashi@shse.u-hyogo.ac.jp,"Hirano, Yasuhiro/I-6411-2014",,,,,24,5,5,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

We tested the hypothesis that native congeners differ in their nodule bacteria associations compared to L. cuneata. Methods Plots with high L. cuneata invasion, low L. cuneata invasion with native Lespedeza species present, and uninvaded plots where native Lespedeza species existed without L. cuneata were sampled. Nodules were collected from all Lespedeza species present, and Chamaecrista fasciculata, a common native annual legume. Bacterial DNA from nodules was isolated and sequenced. Results Nodule bacterial composition differed significantly between hosts. L. cuneata nodules contained high frequencies of rhizobial DNA and low bacterial diversity, while native Lespedeza nodules contained lower rhizobial frequencies and higher non-rhizobial bacterial diversity. Specific non-rhizobial bacterial groups exhibited strong associations with native legumes and uninvaded sites. Conclusions Significant differences exist in the nodule bacterial composition between native legumes and an introduced congener. The mechanism(s) and ecological importance of these differences remain unknown. These differences in bacterial associations could influence not only the competitive ability of the invader, but recovery of invaded sites as well.","[Busby, Ryan R.; Rodriguez, Giselle; Gebhart, Dick L.] US Army, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, 2902 Newmark Dr, Champaign, IL 61822 USA; [Yannarell, Anthony C.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Busby, RR (reprint author), US Army, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, 2902 Newmark Dr, Champaign, IL 61822 USA.",ryan.r.busby@usace.army.mil,"Yannarell, Anthony/AAA-1720-2019",,United States Army Direct Funded Research Program [A896],This research was funded by the United States Army A896 Direct Funded Research Program.,,54,4,5,3,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2016,401,2-Jan,,,,,427,436,,10.1007/s11104-015-2763-3,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,DH7CC,WOS:000372947800030,,,,,10/31/19J,"Glaeser, SP; Imani, J; Alabid, I; Guo, HJ; Kumar, N; Kampfer, P; Hardt, M; Blom, J; Goesmann, A; Rothballer, M; Hartmann, A; Kogel, KH",,,,"Glaeser, Stefanie P.; Imani, Jafargholi; Alabid, Ibrahim; Guo, Huijuan; Kumar, Neelendra; Kaempfer, Peter; Hardt, Martin; Blom, Jochen; Goesmann, Alexander; Rothballer, Michael; Hartmann, Anton; Kogel, Karl-Heinz",,,Non-pathogenic Rhizobium radiobacter F4 deploys plant beneficial activity independent of its host Piriformospora indica,ISME JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; ARABIDOPSIS ROOTS; METHYL JASMONATE; GENOME; ENDOBACTERIA; COLONIZATION; BACTERIA; GROWTH; SEQUENCE,"The Alphaproteobacterium Rhizobium radiobacter F4 (RrF4) was originally characterized as an endofungal bacterium in the beneficial endophytic Sebacinalean fungus Piriformospora indica. Although attempts to cure P. indica from RrF4 repeatedly failed, the bacterium can easily be grown in pure culture. Here, we report on RrF4's genome and the beneficial impact the free-living bacterium has on plants. In contrast to other endofungal bacteria, the genome size of RrF4 is not reduced. Instead, it shows a high degree of similarity to the plant pathogenic R. radiobacter (formerly: Agrobacterium tumefaciens) C58, except vibrant differences in both the tumor-inducing (pTi) and the accessor (pAt) plasmids, which can explain the loss of RrF4's pathogenicity. Similar to its fungal host, RrF4 colonizes plant roots without host preference and forms aggregates of attached cells and dense biofilms at the root surface of maturation zones. RrF4-colonized plants show increased biomass and enhanced resistance against bacterial leaf pathogens. Mutational analysis showed that, similar to P. indica, resistance mediated by RrF4 was dependent on the plant's jasmonate-based induced systemic resistance (ISR) pathway. Consistent with this, RrF4- and P. indica-induced pattern of defense gene expression were similar. In clear contrast to P. indica, but similar to plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, RrF4 colonized not only the root outer cortex but also spread beyond the endodermis into the stele. On the basis of our findings, RrF4 is an efficient plant growth-promoting bacterium.","[Glaeser, Stefanie P.; Kaempfer, Peter] Univ Giessen, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Inst Appl Microbiol, IFZ Heinrich Buff Ring 26, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Imani, Jafargholi; Alabid, Ibrahim; Guo, Huijuan; Kumar, Neelendra; Kogel, Karl-Heinz] Univ Giessen, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Inst Phytopathol, IFZ Heinrich Buff Ring 26, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Hardt, Martin] Univ Giessen, Seltersberg Imaging Unit, Biomed Res Ctr, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Blom, Jochen; Goesmann, Alexander] Univ Giessen, Bioinformat & Syst Biol, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Rothballer, Michael; Hartmann, Anton] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Res Unit Microbe Plant Interact, Neuherberg, Germany","Glaeser, SP (reprint author), Univ Giessen, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Inst Appl Microbiol, IFZ Heinrich Buff Ring 26, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.; Kogel, KH (reprint author), Univ Giessen, Res Ctr BioSyst Land Use & Nutr, Inst Phytopathol, IFZ Heinrich Buff Ring 26, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.; Hartmann, A (reprint author), German Res Ctr Environm Hlth GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Dept Environm Sci, Res Unit Microbe Plant Interact, Ingolstaedter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",stefanie.glaeser@umwelt.uni-giessen.de; anton.hartmann@helmholtz-muenchen.de; karl-heinz.kogel@agrar.uni-giessen.de,"Kampfer, Peter/P-7643-2019; Rothballer, Michael/B-5219-2015; Kogel, KH/K-1626-2019","Kampfer, Peter/0000-0002-7165-3418; Rothballer, Michael/0000-0003-4881-2705; Kogel, KH/0000-0003-1226-003X; Goesmann, Alexander/0000-0002-7086-2568","German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [KO 1208/24-1, DFG KA 875/8-1]","We thank S Agel, B Honig and A Moebus for technical assistance and Dr Jorn Pons-Kuhnemann for his support on statistical analysis.

Here, we cultured 1292 Bradyrhizobium isolates from symbiotic root nodules and the soil root interface of the host plant Acmispon strigosus across a > 840-km transect in California. To investigate epidemiology and the potential role of accessory loci as epidemic drivers, isolates were genotyped at two chromosomal loci and were assayed for presence or absence of accessory ""symbiosis island"" loci that encode capacity to form nodules on hosts. We found that Bradyrhizobium populations were very diverse but dominated by few haplotypes-with a single ""epidemic"" haplotype constituting nearly 30 % of collected isolates and spreading nearly statewide. In many Bradyrhizobium lineages, we inferred presence and absence of the symbiosis island suggesting recurrent evolutionary gain and or loss of symbiotic capacity. We did not find statistical phylogenetic evidence that the symbiosis island acquisition promotes strain dominance and both symbiotic and non-symbiotic strains exhibited population dominance and spatial spread. Our dataset reveals that a strikingly few Bradyrhizobium genotypes can rapidly spread to dominate a landscape and suggests that these epidemics are not driven by the acquisition of accessory loci as occurs in key human pathogens.","[Hollowell, A.

In this study, we investigated the dynamics of soil organic carbon (OC) following farmland abandonment along with similar to 160 years of vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau, China. Our specific objectives were to examine the variation of soil OC decomposition rates, to quantify the changes in the proportion of new and old soil OC, and to explore the factors controlling soil OC stock patterns. The results showed that the rate of new soil OC increase was higher in the early stage (similar to 10 years) after land-use change. The rate of new soil OC increase ranged from 109.17 to 41.88 g m(-2) year(-1) in the early (similar to 10 years) and later stages (similar to 160 years), respectively. It took about 30 years for the amount of new soil OC to reach the same level as old OC in the top 20 cm of soil following farmland abandonment. Also, soil OC decomposition rate was higher (decomposition rate constants = 0.04) in the early stage (similar to 10 years) and showed a non-significant difference after >30 years of vegetation restoration. Our results suggested that soil C/N is the most factor to effect on soil OC sequestration following vegetation restoration, and the proportions of new soil OC was mainly determined by fine roots, soil OC decomposition rate constants were mainly determined by soil silt content, and the rates of new soil OC increase were mainly determined by soil sand content that these observations were made out of considering many other soil properties.

Although some studies have reported the presence of 29 % of the reported species in the world, the knowledge regarding their functional diversity is poor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the disturbance on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) functional diversity. Three sites at the Biosphere Reserve Los Tuxtlas in the state of Veracruz were selected for this study, according to the disturbance gradient and the land use: Lpez Mateos (LM), San Fernando (SF), and Venustiano Carranza (VC) (with low, medium and high disturbance, respectively). The land use in each site includes milpa and pasture. High percentages of root colonization, spore abundance and spore viability were found on LM soils. Additionally, 100 % of the pasture soils have a high mycorrhizal infective potential (MIP). In addition, the fungi consortiums coming from that site promote the highest mycorrhizal growth response (MGR), with increases ranging from 74.1 to 194.6 % over the control treatment. SF soils had high percentages of root colonization and spore viability, whereas only 20 % of these soils had a high MIP, and their MGR promoted increases ranged from 14.6 to 120.4 % over the control. Soils from VC had the lowest percentages of root colonization and spore viability. Only 10 % of the soils had high MIP, and their MGR was not better than the control.

Conservation of these sensitive and vulnerable habitats requires the recognition of climate change effects so environmental managers can develop and apply appropriate intervention and adaptation strategies where possible. Here we focus on Spartina patens (saltmeadow cordgrass), a foundation species of New England (USA) coastal marshes. A growing, body of evidence suggests this species is disappearing rapidly from wetlands in the region, leading to reductions in habitat quality, plant diversity, carbon sequestration, erosion resistance and coastal protection. We grew S. patens under five inundation and three precipitation regimes, monitored changes in its extent within two Southern New England coastal marshes (2000-2014), and used water level and precipitation data to detect changes in environmental conditions affecting these marshes. Our results suggest that current inundation patterns have reduced the persistence of S. patens, while short-term drought did not appear responsible for vegetation changes or habitat conversion. We conclude that accelerated sea level rise is incompatible with the long-term survival of S. patens within the current landscape footprint of Southern New England's coastal wetlands. We suggest that conservation actions focused on high marsh preservation concentrate on facilitating the process of marsh migration onto uplands by prioritizing buffer conservation, conducting barrier removal and allowing for retreat where feasible.

Comparatively little research has focussed on the soil chemistry of tropical nickel hyperaccumulator plants to date. This study aimed to elucidate whether the soil chemistry associated with nickel hyperaccumulator plants has distinctive characteristics that could be indicative of specific edaphic requirements. The soil chemistry associated with 18 different nickel hyperaccumulator plant species occurring in Sabah (Malaysia) was compared with local ultramafic soils where nickel hyperaccumulator plants were absent. The results showed that nickel hyperaccumulators in the study area were restricted to circum-neutral soils with relatively high phytoavailable calcium, magnesium and nickel concentrations. There appeared to be a 'threshold response' for the presence of nickel hyperaccumulator plants at > 20 mu g g(-1) carboxylic-extractable nickel or > 630 mu g g(-1) total nickel, and > pH 6.3 thereby delimiting their edaphic range. Two (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses were proposed to explain nickel hyperaccumulation on these soils: (1) hyperaccumulators excrete large amounts of root exudates thereby increasing nickel phytoavailability through intense rhizosphere mineral weathering; and (2) hyperaccumulators have extremely high nickel uptake efficiency thereby severely depleting nickel and stimulating re-supply of Ni from diffusion from labile Ni pools. It was concluded that since there was an association with soils with highly labile nickel pools, the available evidence primarily supports hypothesis (2).","[van der Ent, Antony] Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Mined Land Rehabil, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [van der Ent, Antony; Echevarria, Guillaume] Univ Lorraine, INRA, Lab Sols & Environm, UMR 1120, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Tibbett, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Ctr Agri Environm Res, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Tibbett, Mark] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Soil Res Ctr, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England","van der Ent, A (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Mined Land Rehabil, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.; van der Ent, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, INRA, Lab Sols & Environm, UMR 1120, F-54000 Nancy, France.",a.vanderent@uq.edu.au,"Tibbett, Mark/P-2079-2019; van der Ent, Antony/A-7486-2015; Echevarria, Guillaume/B-3680-2012","Tibbett, Mark/0000-0003-0143-2190; van der Ent, Antony/0000-0003-0922-5065; Echevarria, Guillaume/0000-0003-2124-1447","Sabah Parks; SaBC; University of QueenslandUniversity of Queensland; IPRS scholarship in Australia; French National Research Agency through the national ""Investissements d'avenir'' programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-21 - LABEX RESSOURCES21]","We wish to thank Sabah Parks for their support and the SaBC for granting permission for conducting research in Sabah, and to extend our gratitude to Sukaibin Sumail and Rositti Karim (Sabah Parks) for help in Kinabalu Park.

An explanation for these monodominant forests remains elusive, but may be linked to mycorrhizal symbioses. We tested three hypotheses by which ectomycorrhizas might facilitate the dominance of the tree, Oreomunnea mexicana, in montane tropical forest in Panama. We tested whether access to ectomycorrhizal networks improved growth and survival of seedlings, evaluated whether ectomycorrhizal fungi promote seedling growth via positive plant-soil feedback, and measured whether Oreomunnea reduced inorganic nitrogen availability. We found no evidence that Oreomunnea benefits from ectomycorrhizal networks or plant-soil feedback. However, we found three-fold higher soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations outside than inside Oreomunnea-dominated forest and a correlation between soil nitrate and Oreomunnea abundance in plots.

However, the indirect effects of reduced precipitation on litter decomposition through changes in litter quality and soil microbial communities are poorly studied. This is especially the case for fine root litter, which contributes importantly to forests plant biomass. Here we analyzed the effects of long-term (11 years) rainfall exclusion (29% reduction) on leaf and fine root litter quality, soil microbial biomass, and microbial community-level physiological profiles in a Mediterranean holm oak forest. Additionally, we reciprocally transplanted soils and litter among the control and reduced rainfall treatments in the laboratory, and analyzed litter decomposition and its responses to a simulated extreme drought event. The decreased soil microbial biomass and altered physiological profiles with reduced rainfall promoted lower fine root-but not leaf-litter decomposition. Both leaf and root litter, from the reduced rainfall treatment, decomposed faster than those from the control treatment. The impact of the extreme drought event on fine root litter decomposition was higher in soils from the control treatment compared to soils subjected to long-term rainfall exclusion. Our results suggest contrasting mechanisms driving drought indirect effects on above-(for example, changes in litter quality) and belowground (for example, shifts in soil microbial community) litter decomposition, even within a single tree species. Quantifying the contribution of these mechanisms relative to the direct soil moisture-effect is critical for an accurate integration of litter decomposition into ecosystem carbon dynamics in Mediterranean forests under climate change.","[Garcia-Palacios, Pablo; Prieto, Ivan; Ourcival, Jean-Marc; Haettenschwiler, Stephan] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Garcia-Palacios, P (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",pablogpom@yahoo.es,"Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/K-7567-2014; Prieto, Ivan/S-7822-2016","Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/0000-0002-6367-4761; Prieto, Ivan/0000-0001-5549-1132",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under REA GrantEuropean Union (EU) [DE-COMFORECO-2011-299214],"We thank Noelia Portillo and Patrick Schevin for laboratory support.

We examined the responses of R (S), heterotrophic respiration (R (H)), autotrophic respiration (R (A)), nitrogen (N) availability, and fine-root biomass to increased temperature in an open-field soil warming experiment. The experiment was conducted in a cool-temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in northern Japan. As this forest is subjected to strong temporal variation in temperature, on scales ranging from daily to seasonal, we also investigated the temporal variation in the effects of soil warming on R (S), R (H), and R (A). Soil temperature was continuously elevated by about 4.0A degrees C from 2007 to 2014 using heating wires buried in the soil, and we measured soil respiratory processes in all four seasons from 2012 to 2014. Soil warming increased annual R (S) by 32-45%, but the magnitude of the increase was different between the components: R (H) and R (A) were also stimulated, and increased by 39-41 and 17-18%, respectively. Soil N availability during the growing season and fine-root biomass were not remarkably affected by the warming treatment. We found that the warming effects varied seasonally. R (H) increased significantly throughout the year, but the warming effect showed remarkable seasonal differences, with the maximum stimulation in the spring. This suggests that warmer spring temperature will produce a greater increase in CO2 release than warmer summer temperatures. In addition, we found that soil warming reduced the temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) of R (S). Although the Q (10) of both R (H) and R (A) tended to be reduced, the decrease in the Q (10) of R (S) was caused mainly by a decrease in the response of R (A) to warming. These long-term results indicate that a balance between the rapid and large response of soil microbes and the acclimation of plant roots both play important roles in determining the response of R (S) to soil warming, and must be carefully considered to predict the responses of soil C dynamics under future temperature conditions.","[Noh, Nam-Jin; Kuribayashi, Masatoshi; Saitoh, Taku M.; Muraoka, Hiroyuki] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Kuribayashi, Masatoshi] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, 2054-120 Kitago, Nagano 3810075, Japan; [Nakaji, Tatsuro; Hiura, Tsutom] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northen Biosphere, Tomakomai Res Stn, Tomakomai 0530035, Japan; [Nakamura, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northen Biosphere, Nakagawa Res Stn, Otoineppu, Nakagawa 0982501, Japan","Noh, NJ (reprint author), Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",forestreeworld@gmail.com,"Hiura, Tsutom/S-7395-2017; Saitoh, Taku/G-8436-2011","Saitoh, Taku/0000-0003-4667-9736","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [GR048]; JSPS KAKENHI programMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26241005, PU13007]; Japanese Alps Inter-University Cooperative Project Fund of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers (NEXT Program GR048 to H.

Here, we applied Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics to disclose the metabolic patterns of cork oak roots and P.cinnamomi mycelium during the early hours of the interaction. As early as 2h post-inoculation (hpi), cork oak roots showed altered metabolic patterns with significant variations for regions associated with carbohydrate, glycoconjugate and lipid groups when compared to mock-inoculated plants. These variations were further extended at 8hpi. Surprisingly, at 16hpi, the metabolic changes in inoculated and mock-inoculated plants were similar, and at 24hpi, the metabolic patterns of the regions mentioned above were inverted when compared to samples collected at 8hpi. Principal component analysis of the FT-IR spectra confirmed that the metabolic patterns of inoculated cork oak roots could be readily distinguished from those of mock-inoculated plants at 2, 8 and 24hpi, but not at 16hpi. FT-IR spectral analysis from mycelium of P.cinnamomi exposed to cork oak root exudates revealed contrasting variations for regions associated with protein groups at 16 and 24h post-exposure (hpe), whereas carbohydrate and glycoconjugate groups varied mainly at 24hpe. Our results revealed early alterations in the metabolic patterns of the host plant when interacting with the biotrophic pathogen. In addition, the FT-IR technique can be successfully applied to discriminate infected cork oak plants from mock-inoculated plants, although these differences were dynamic with time. To a lesser extent, the metabolic patterns of P.cinnamomi were also altered when exposed to cork oak root exudates.","[Hardoim, P.

This intended or unintended fertilization can have a wide-range of impacts on biotic communities and hence on soil respiration. Reduction in below-ground carbon (C) allocation induced by high N availability has been assumed to be a major mechanism determining the effects of N enrichment on soil respiration. In addition to increasing available N, however, N enrichment causes soil acidification, which may also affect root and microbial activities. The relative importance of increased N availability vs. soil acidification on soil respiration in natural ecosystems experiencing N enrichment is unclear. We conducted a 12-year N enrichment experiment and a 4-year complementary acid addition experiment in a semi-arid Inner Mongolian grassland. We found that N enrichment had contrasting effects on root and microbial respiration. N enrichment significantly increased root biomass, root N content and specific root respiration, thereby promoting root respiration. In contrast, N enrichment significantly suppressed microbial respiration likely by reducing total microbial biomass and changing the microbial community composition. The effect on root activities was due to both soil acidity and increased available N, while the effect on microbes primarily stemmed from soil acidity, which was further confirmed by results from the acid addition experiment. Our results indicate that soil acidification exerts a greater control than soil N availability on soil respiration in grasslands experiencing long-term N enrichment. These findings suggest that N-induced soil acidification should be included in predicting terrestrial ecosystem C balance under future N deposition scenarios.","[Chen, Dima; Li, Jianjun; Lan, Zhichun; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dima; Hu, Shuijin] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Box 7616, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Bai, YF (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Chen, Dima/H-4060-2013","Chen, Dima/0000-0002-1687-0401","Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research [2015CB954201]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31320103916, 31030013]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050400]","We thank Professor Erland Baath for his help in MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System.

Internal community structure was investigated through fitting the rank-abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units to different models. Heterogeneity of communities within islands was assessed by analysis of group dispersion. The mean OTU richness per sample was significantly lower on the artificial island than on the neighboring natural island, indicating that richness of the colonizing AM fungal community is restricted by limited dispersal. The AM fungal communities colonizing the new island appeared to be a non-random subset of communities on the natural and much older neighboring island, which points to high colonization potential of certain probably early successional mycorrhizal fungi, likely assisted by migratory birds.

Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e., saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds, another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed fungal species.

This increased species richness may reflect a positive response to global change factors including increased temperature, atmospheric CO2, habitat fragmentation, and drought severity; however, questions remain as to the specific mechanisms facilitating the response. Previous work suggests that lianas may gain an ecological advantage over trees through leaf functional traits that offer a quick return on investment of resources, although it is unknown whether this pattern extends to root traits and relationships with fungal or bacterial symbionts belowground. We sampled confamilial pairs of liana and tree species and quantified morphological and chemical traits of leaves and fine roots, as well as root symbiont abundance, to determine whether functional traits associated with resource acquisition differed between the two. Compared to trees, lianas possessed higher specific leaf area, specific root length, root branching intensity, and root nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, and lower leaf and root tissue density, leaf and root carbon (C), root diameter, root C:P and N:P, and mycorrhizal colonization. Our study provides new evidence that liana leaf and root traits are characterized by a rapid resource acquisition strategy relative to trees. These liana functional traits may facilitate their response to global change, raising questions about how increased liana dominance might affect ecosystem processes of Neotropical forests.","[Collins, Courtney G.; Wurzburger, Nina] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wright, S.

In this study, the communities of both soil bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated using tagged pyrosequencing for three types of slope aspects (south-facing aspect, north-facing aspect and flat area) in a boreal forest of the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. The bacterial and AMF community composition differed with slope aspects. Bacterial diversity was the lowest on the north-facing aspect, and AMF diversity was the lowest on the flat area. Aspects also had a significant impact on soil pH and available phosphorus (P) and shrubby biomass. Soil pH and understory shrub biomass were significantly correlated with bacterial communities, and soil available P and shrub biomass showed significant correlations with AMF communities. Our results suggested that slope aspects affected bacterial and AMF communities, mediated by aspect-induced changes in plant community and soil chemical properties (e.g., pH and available P), which improved the knowledge on the effects of forest slope aspects on aboveground and belowground communities.","[Chu Haiyan; Xiang Xingjia; Zhang Kaoping; Li Yuntao; Shi Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Adams, Jonathan M.] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Seoul 151, South Korea; [Xiang Xingjia; Zhang Kaoping; Li Yuntao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Xiang, XJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Xiang, XJ (reprint author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xjxiang@issas.ac.cn,", yshi@issas.ac.cn/P-3378-2015",", yshi@issas.ac.cn/0000-0001-9612-8321; Adams, Jonathan/0000-0001-7954-8332; Xiang, Xingjia/0000-0003-4410-1789",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010101]; National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB954002]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41371254],"We thank Ms. LIU Weili, Dr. CAI Wenhua, Mr. LIU Bo, and Dr. FANG Lei from the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for assistance in sampling and Dr. XIONG Jingbo from the Ningbo University of China for assistance in bioinformatic analysis.

This information is not only needed to improve basic understanding of water use in these forests but also to improve descriptions of root function at depth in hydrologic process models. The study took place at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in central Pennsylvania. We asked two main questions: (i) Do trees in a mixed-hardwood, humid temperate forest in a central Pennsylvania catchment rely on deep roots for water during dry portions of the growing season? (ii) What is the role of tree genus, size, soil depth and hillslope position on the depth of water extraction by trees? Based on multiple lines of evidence, including stable isotope natural abundance, sap flux and soil moisture depletion patterns with depth, the majority of water uptake during the dry part of the growing season occurred, on average, at less than similar to 60 cm soil depth throughout the catchment. While there were some trends in depth of water uptake related to genus, tree size and soil depth, water uptake was more uniformly shallow than we expected. Our results suggest that these types of forests may rely considerably on water sources that are quite shallow, even in the drier parts of the growing season.","[Gaines, Katie P.; Chen, Weile; Adams, Thomas S.; Lin, Henry; Eissenstat, David M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Stanley, Jane W.] Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Meinzer, Frederick C.; Woodruff, David R.] US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97208 USA; [McCulloh, Katherine A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Eissenstat, DM (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dme9@psu.edu,"Lin, Henry/E-8234-2011; Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019","Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 07-25019, EAR 12-39285, EAR 13-31726, 09-47962]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","Financial and logistical support and data were provided by National Science Foundation Grant EAR 07-25019 (C.

Mid-elevation trees experience a montane Mediterranean climate, with near-freezing winter days and rain-free summers. The asynchrony between warmth and water input suggests low primary production, limited by photosynthetic dormancy in winter cold, and again in summer and early autumn with drought, yet this forest is characterized by tall trees and high biomass. We used eddy covariance in a mid-elevation Sierra stand to understand how winter cold and summer drought limit canopy photosynthesis and production. The trees exhibited canopy photosynthesis year-round. Trees avoided winter dormancy, and daytime CO2 uptake continued despite a deep snowpack and near-freezing temperatures. Photosynthesis on sunny days continued at half of maximum rates when air temperature was 0 degrees C. Likewise, the vegetation avoided summer drought dormancy, and high rates of daytime CO2 uptake and transpiration continued despite a 5-month period with only negligible water input. We attribute this drought avoidance to deep rooting and availability of deep soil water. Year-round photosynthesis helps explain the large biomass observed in the Sierra Nevada, and implies adaptive strategies that may contribute to the resiliency or vulnerability of Sierran vegetation to climate change.","[Kelly, Anne E.; Goulden, Michael L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kelly, Anne E.] US Geol Survey, Canyonlands Res Stn, Moab, UT 84532 USA","Kelly, AE (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Kelly, AE (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Canyonlands Res Stn, Moab, UT 84532 USA.",akelly@usgs.gov,"Goulden, Michael L/B-9934-2008",,US National Science Foundation through the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory [EAR 0725097]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Jenkins Fellowship; National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Fellowship,"This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation through the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (EAR 0725097) and the US Department of Energy Terrestrial Ecosystem Studies program to M.L.G.

In particular, fine root production (FRP) comprises a large component of the NPP. However, information on root production remains scarce. We studied FRP in three zones (Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus) of a mangrove forest in eastern Thailand using ingrowth cores (0-30 cm of soil depth). The root biomass and necromass were periodically harvested from the cores and weighed during the one-year study. The FRP was determined by summation of the fine root biomass (FRB) and root necromass. The results showed that the FRB clearly increased in the wet and cool dry seasons. Magnitude of FRB in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones was 1171.07 and 764.23 g/m(2)/30 cm, respectively. The lowest FRB (292.74 g/m(2)/30 cm) was recorded in the Avicennia zone locating on the river edge where there is a greater frequency of inundation than the other zones. Root necromass was high in the Rhizophora and Xylocarpus zones, and accumulated noticeably when soil temperatures rapidly declined during the middle of the wet season to cool dry season. However, root necromass in the Avicennia zone varied within a small range. We attributed the small accumulation of root necromass in the Avicennia zone to the relative high soil temperature that likely caused a high root decomposition rate. The average FRP (3.403-4.079 ton/ha/year) accounted for 74.4, 81.5, and 92.4 % of the total root production in the Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zone, respectively. The root production and causative factors (i.e., soil temperature and inundation regime) are discussed in relation to the carbon cycle of a mangrove forest.","[Poungparn, Sasitorn; Charoenphonphakdi, Thanyalak; Patanaponpaiboon, Pipat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Sangtiean, Tanuwong] Off Mangrove Conservat, Dept Marine & Coastal Resources, Bangkok 10210, Thailand","Poungparn, S (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",sasitorn.p@chula.ac.th,,,,,,31,8,8,5,41,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0931-1890,1432-2285,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

To what extent changes in the species composition of temperate forests and increases in the frequency and duration of summer droughts in the course of global climate change will alter GHG emissions remains unclear. We analyzed the effect of tree species identity and mycorrhizal association type vs. soil drought on GHG fluxes by conducting a greenhouse experiment with four important deciduous tree species which form either ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. We combined soil gas flux measurements with analyses of leaf gas fluxes, potential fine root respiration, fine root growth and turnover, and N turnover in soil microsites. Our experiment tests the hypotheses that (1) GHG emissions differ between tree species and mycorrhizal association type mainly due to differences in root activity and root-induced processes, and (2) soil drought decreases the amount of GHG exchange from different tree species to a different extent. We found a two times higher global warming potential (GWP) from soil gas exchange in European ash than in the other three tree species (1.9 vs. 0.8-1.0 g CO2-eq kg(-1) h(-1)) mainly due to much higher root mass-specific CO2 emission rates (495 vs. 210-236 mg C kg(-1) h(-1)). Apart from the influence of species differences in fine root productivity, we show a stronger increase in CO2 emission rates per portion of white roots in ash which may indicate a higher metabolic activity of unsuberized fine roots in this tree species. Ectomycorrhizal tree species differed from arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species by a two times greater increase in CO2 emissions per fine root production. The N2O emissions per root mass were up to five times higher in beech than in the other species, caused either by higher nitrate production in the rhizosphere or by lower nitrate consumption. Soil porosity drove the amount of methane uptake, while biotic influences were subordinate. Soil drought generally exerted an important control on GHG fluxes: low water-filled pore space decreased the GWP from soil emissions by only 9% in sycamore, but by 40% (European beech) to 68% (European ash) in the other tree species and largely diminished any tree species differences. This suggests that tree species identity may substantially alter the GWP of temperate forests through rhizosphere processes, but this influence on GHG exchange is diminished by soil drought.

Root tips of both < 0.5 and 0.5-1 mm were mainly produced in the organic soil layer, while root tips of 0.5-1 mm were mainly produced in the mineral soil layer. Because of the high RT1 root tip production in the organic soil layer, branching intensity was higher in the organic soil than in the mineral soil layer during summer.

To determine the effectiveness of Jatropha curcas L. as a bio-engineering plant we measured stem diameter and height of 1, 3, 5, 6, 18, and 36 month -old plants, and root distribution at 6, 18, and 36 months by full excavation of the root system. We also measured in the laboratory the elastic modulus and maximum tensile force of 50 roots. These data were used to calibrate a weighted log -likelihood root distribution model and a root reinforcement model. Models were coupled to estimate root reinforcement at stand scale over a three year period as a function of the plantation's tree density. Our results of root distribution indicate a rapid decrease of root diameter along the root length leading to rapidly decreasing root reinforcement with distance from the stem. Minimal root reinforcements at 0.5 m from the stem is about 1 and 11 kPa for 18 and 36 -month old plants, respectively. At 1 m from the stem only 36 -month old plants provide any significant root reinforcement. Despite its relatively low root reinforcement relative to other larger tree species Jatropha curcas L. is a suitable bio-engineering plant because it easily propagates, grows fast, and is resilient. Root reinforcement in the first stage of growth needs high density plantation of up to 40,000 plants per hectare.

Such genomic information can shed light on the agents and targets of selection maintaining cooperation in nature. We recently demonstrated that N-fertilization has caused an evolutionary decline in mutualistic partner quality in the rhizobia that form symbiosis with clover. Here, population genomic analyses of N-fertilized versus control rhizobium populations indicate that evolutionary differentiation at a key symbiosis gene region on the symbiotic plasmid (pSym) contributes to partner quality decline. Moreover, patterns of genetic variation at selected loci were consistent with recent positive selection within N-fertilized environments, suggesting that N-rich environments might select for less beneficial rhizobia. By studying the molecular population genomics of a natural bacterial population within a long-term ecological field experiment, we find that: (i) the N environment is indeed a potent selective force mediating mutualism evolution in this symbiosis, (ii) natural variation in rhizobium partner quality is mediated in part by key symbiosis genes on the symbiotic plasmid, and (iii) differentiation at selected genes occurred in the context of otherwise recombining genomes, resembling eukaryotic models of adaptation.","[Klinger, Christie R.; Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Heath, KD (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kheath@illinois.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1257938]; NSF LTER Program at the Kellogg Biological Station [DEB-1027253]; Michigan State University AgBioResearch,"This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF DEB-1257938), the NSF LTER Program at the Kellogg Biological Station (DEB-1027253), and Michigan State University AgBioResearch.",,94,9,9,2,59,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Moreover, a single mycelium can potentially stretch over kilometres, and it is unlikely that its distant parts share resources or have the same fitness. Here, we directly measure how a single mycelium of the model ascomycete Neurospora crassa is patterned into reproductive units (RUs), meaning subpopulations of nuclei that propagate together as spores, and function as reproductive individuals. The density of RUs is sensitive to the geometry of growth; we detected 50-fold smaller RUs when mycelia had expanding frontiers than when they were constrained to grow in one direction only. RUs fragmented further when the rnycelial network was perturbed. In mycelia with expanding frontiers, RU composition was strongly influenced by the distribution of genotypes early in development. Our results provide a concept of fungal individuality that is directly connected to reproductive potential, and therefore to theories of how fungal individuals adapt and evolve over time. Our data show that the size of reproductive individuals is a dynamic and environment-dependent property, even within apparently totally connected fungal mycelia.","[Ma, Linda; Song, Boya; Curran, Thomas; Nhu Phong; Roper, Marcus] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Roper, Marcus] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dressaire, Emilie] NYU, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA","Roper, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Roper, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biomath, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mroper@math.ucla.edu,,"Ma, Linda/0000-0002-2950-6086","Alfred P.

Accordingly, there is growing concern that the spread of exotic earthworms into northern temperate forests may compromise biodiversity and tree species recruitment. We report on a study where we sampled earthworms, soils, and understory plants in plots established in 40 mature sugar maple stands distributed over 3 areas in the Eastern Townships of Southern Quebec (Canada). Earthworms were found in 19 of 40 plots, and earthworm frequency of occurrence (E-fo) as well as the complexity of earthworm communities reflected human accessibility to the plots. Plant species richness decreased, and species evenness increased, with Efo. The Efo was related to a decrease in the cover of 5 plant species, and to an increase in the cover of 2 other plant species or plant functional groups. Increasing Em also correlated with higher soil pH, lower forest floor thickness and lower soil C:N ratio. Among these 3 variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that soil pH and forest floor thickness correlated with plant community composition. Based on neutral lipid and phospholipid fatty acid profiles, we found that soil bacteria and fungi increased with a decrease in forest floor thickness, bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increased with soil pH, whereas actinobacteria and AMF increased with Efo. We discuss the possible mechanisms by which earthworms might directly or indirectly alter understory plant community composition. By considering the location and land use management of each study site, our study provides further evidence that the spread of exotic earthworms in sugar maple stands of Southern Quebec may be linked to human activities, with implications for further research and conservation issues.

While previous research has shown that the soil heating from smoldering fires resulted in short-term reductions in coarse root non-structural carbohydrates and latewood growth, information on the long-term effects of smoldering fire is lacking. Our study compared the effects of three smoldering fire treatments (root only, stem only, root and stem) and two control treatments (no fire and surface fire only) on longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) growth and defense ten years after treatments. We cored 17-29 similar sized trees per treatment and measured growth as basal area increment and defense as resin duct properties (e.g., resin duct size, % resin duct area). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the influence of smoldering treatments and climate on basal area increment and resin duct properties. Variation in basal area increment and resin duct size during the previous ten years were positively correlated with the subsequent ten years, r(2) = 0.71 and r(2) = 0.65, respectively. Additionally, temporal variation in growth and defense were related to climatic factors. Growth had the strongest correlation with current August temperatures (r = -0.50), and defense had the strongest correlation with current December temperatures (r = -0.64). Basal area increment was best predicted by summer and fall Palmer Drought Severity Index, while resin duct size was best predicted by the interaction of treatment and precipitation during the previous November. During the three driest years following treatment smoldering duration had a negative relationship with basal area increment (p < 0.0085; r(2) = 0.08) and resin duct size (p < 0.0003; r(2) = 0.16). While longleaf pine growth was generally resistant to long-duration soil heating following years of fire exclusion, the proceeding growth response was contingent on the post-fire climate. Longleaf pine resin duct size was sensitive to the effects of smoldering fire, and potential negative impacts may be exacerbated by lower precipitation. Restoring fire to long-unburned sites proceeded by warmer and drier climate conditions may result in reduced longleaf pine growth and defense that may contribute to increased probability of mortality during subsequent disturbances.

KARST.; PICEA-ABIES; COARSE ROOTS; TREE-RINGS; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT; EDGE; TRENDS; TERM; STEM,"New forest edges are continuously being created by forest management. In the Swiss Alps, silvicultural treatments have partly changed from the selection cutting widespread two decades ago to a more intensive strip cutting. However, little is known about the impact of such harvesting on tree growth and on the structural development of Alpine forest stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), which have high economic and protective value. We therefore investigated the effect of strip cutting in four Alpine spruce stands differing in site and stand conditions through a dendrochronological analysis of 134 tree stems. The change in growth rate was assessed for the 10-year period before and after the cutting year, and rate changes in edge and non-edge trees were compared. The relative change in Hegyi's competition index before and after the cut was used as a proxy for the change in space and related resources. A linear model was developed to assess the effects of biotic and abiotic variables on changes in growth after strip cutting. Radial growth responses varied greatly between the stands, with a significant increase only in edge trees in the two north-facing sites, i.e. 12% and 60%. Changes in tree competition had the strongest impact on tree growth, followed by site effects. With the same relative change in competition index, the radial growth of edge trees increased more strongly in reaction to cutting than that of non-edge trees. Additionally, small-diameter trees growing near edges benefited more from the strip cutting than larger trees. Our results suggest that strip cutting on north-facing slopes can boost the growth of trees on the east and north-east-facing forest edges. Small spruce trees growing along newly created forest edges can be kept to enhance stand yield. As cutting often leads to long forest edges and may thus affect the growth of a significant proportion of the forest area, such effects should be considered in planning cutting layouts.

Characterizing the leaching potential of these compounds is essential for predicting their mobility through the soil profile and assessing the risk of groundwater contamination. Plant root exudates can play an important role in the modification of contaminant mobility in soil-plant systems, and such effects should also be considered in leaching studies. Artificially spiked samples of A and B horizons from an alumi-umbric Cambisol were leached in packed-columns and batch experiments using Milli-Qwater and plant root exudates as leaching agents. The leaching potential and rate were strongly influenced by soil-contaminant interactions and by the presence of root exudates. Organic matter in A horizon preferably sorbed the most non-polar contaminants, lowering their leaching potential, and this effect was enhanced by the presence of root exudates. On the other hand, the inorganic components of the B horizon, showed a greater affinity for polar molecules, and the presence of root exudates enhanced the desorption of the contaminants. Column experiments resulted in a more realistic protocol than batch tests for predicting the leaching potential of volatile organic compounds in dissimilar soils. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainty in the estimated stock changes was assessed by combining model and sampling errors associated with the various data sources into variance-covariance matrices that allowed computationally efficient error propagation in the context of Yasso07 simulations. In sensitivity analysis, we found that the uncertainty increased drastically as a result of adding random year-to-year variation to the litter input. Such variation is smoothed out when using periodic inventory data with constant biomass models and turnover rates. Model errors (biomass, litter, understorey vegetation) and the systematic error of total drain had a marginal effect on the uncertainty regarding soil carbon stock change. Most of the uncertainty appears to be related to uncaptured annual variation in litter amounts. This is due to fact that variation in the slopes of litter input trends dictates the uncertainty of soil carbon stock change. If we assume that there is annual variation only in foliage and fine root litter rates and that this variation is less than 10% from year to year, then we can claim that Finnish upland forest soils have accumulated carbon during the first Kyoto period (2008-2012).","[Lehtonen, Aleksi; Heikkinen, Juha] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Jokiniemenkuja 1, FI-01370 Vantaa, Finland","Lehtonen, A (reprint author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Jokiniemenkuja 1, FI-01370 Vantaa, Finland.",aleksi.lehtonen@luke.fi,"Heikkinen, Juha/E-7863-2018","Heikkinen, Juha/0000-0003-3527-774X; Lehtonen, Aleksi/0000-0003-1388-0388",,,,39,2,2,0,1,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We conducted a field experiment with selected genetic lines of the dioecious shrub Baccharis salicifolia to investigate the effects of plant growth rate (two-fold variation) and gender (males vs. females of the same growth rate) on above- and belowground insect and fungal associates. We documented variation in associate density to test for effects occurring through plant-based habitat quality (controlling for effects of plant size) as well as variation in associate abundance to test for effects occurring through both habitat quality and abundance (including effects of plant size). Whereas the dietary specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai was unaffected by plant sex and growth rate, the generalist aphid Aphis gossypii and its tending ants (Linepithema humile) had higher abundances and densities on male (vs. female) plants, suggesting males provide greater habitat quality. In contrast, Aphis and ant abundance and density were unaffected by plant growth rate, while Aphis parasitoids were unaffected by either plant sex or growth rate. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had higher abundance and density (both marginally significant) on females (vs. males), suggesting females provide greater habitat quality, but lower abundances (marginally significant) and higher densities on slow- (vs. fast-) growing genotypes, suggesting slow-growing genotypes provided lower resource abundance but greater habitat quality. Overall, plant sex and growth rate effects on associates acted independently (i.e., no interactive effects), and these effects were of a greater magnitude than those coming from other axes of plant genetic variation. These findings thus demonstrate that plant genetic effects on associated communities may be driven by a small number of trait-specific mechanisms.","[Abdala-Roberts, Luis] Univ Autonoma Yucatan, Dept Ecol Trop, Campus Ciencias Biol & Agr,Apartado Postal 4-11, Merida 97000, Yucatan, Mexico; [Pratt, Jessica D.; Pratt, Riley; Schreck, Tadj K.; Hanna, Victoria; Mooney, Kailen A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Pratt, Riley] Irvine Ranch Conservancy, 4727 Portola Pkwy, Irvine, CA 92620 USA","Mooney, KA (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mooneyk@uci.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354734, DEB-1120794]","Hong Chen, Annie Vo, Laura Ashmore, Wen-chi Ho and Rose Chang assisted in the field and lab.

In this study, we determined that opa22-homologous genes exist in the multiple species of bacteria in Rhizobiales. A conserved domain analysis revealed that the Opa22 homologues are a group of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins, belonging to the surface antigen superfamily. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the Opa22 homologues and showed that Opa22 supports the validity of the 16S rRNA gene for phylogenic classification. Isogenic mutants were made for each homologue of Sinorhizobium medicae USDA1037, Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii LPR5045, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA2110 via double-cross replacement. Plant experiments showed that the mutants had lost nodulation ability with their original host plants, and that this symbiotic phenotype could be restored by functional complementation. Interestingly, opa22 from M. huakuii 7653R partially restored nodulation ability of S. medicae isogenic mutant, but not that of B. japonicum isogenic mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that Opa22 is phylogenetically conserved in rhizobial families and is essential for root nodule formation in some species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Black spruce is adapted to this environment by the continuous development of adventitious roots, masking the root collar and making it difficult to age trees. Ring counts above the root collar underestimate age of trees, but the magnitude of age underestimation of trees in relation to organic layer thickness (OLT) is unknown. This age underestimation is required to produce appropriate age-correction tools to be used in land resource management. The goal of this study was to assess aging errors that are done with standard ring counts of trees growing in sites with different degrees of paludification (OLT; 0-25 cm, 26-65 cm, >65 cm). Age of 81 trees sampled at three geographical locations was determined by ring counts at ground level and at 1 m height, and real age of trees was determined by cross-dating growth rings down to the root collar (root/shoot interface). Ring counts at 1 m height underestimated age of trees by a mean of 22 years (range 13-49) and 52 years (range 14-112) in null to low vs. moderately to highly paludified stands, respectively. The percentage of aging-error explained by our linear model was relatively high (R-adj(2) = 0.71) and showed that OLT class and age at 0-m could be used to predict total aging-error while neither DBH nor geographic location could. The resulting model has important implications for forest management to accurately estimate productivity of these forests.","[Laamrani, Ahmed; DesRochers, Annie; Blackburn, Line] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Forets, 341 Principale N, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada","Laamrani, A (reprint author), Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Inst Rech Forets, 341 Principale N, Amos, PQ J9T 2L8, Canada.",ahmed.laamrani@uqat.ca; annie.desrochers@uqat.ca; line.blackburn@uqat.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; NSERC-UQAT-Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM) Chair in Sustainable Forest Management; Tembec Incorporated; Regional Conference of Elected Representatives of James Bay through the Programme de participation regionale a la mise en valeur des forets-Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources,"This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the NSERC-UQAT-Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM) Chair in Sustainable Forest Management, Tembec Incorporated, and the Regional Conference of Elected Representatives of James Bay through the Programme de participation regionale a la mise en valeur des forets-Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources.

By comparing a widespread exotic invasive species Robinia pseudoacacia L. with a related native one Sophora japonica L., this research aimed to study strategies of R. pseudoacacia for superior performance from the perspective of functional traits. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which seedlings of R. pseudoacacia and S. japonica were grown separately under a factorial combination of two light regimes and three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization, including a control and two levels intended to represent ambient and future levels of N deposition in Chinese forests. After 90 days of treatment, performance and functional traits were determined for the two species, the former referred to as the total biomass (TB) that directly affected fitness. Trait plasticity and integration (the pattern and extent of functional covariance among different plant traits) were analyzed and compared. We found that the two species showed significantly different plastic responses to light increase: in the low-light regime, they were similar in performance and functional traits, while in the high-light regime, R. pseudoacacia achieved a significantly higher TB and a suite of divergent but advantageous functional traits versus S. japonica, such as significantly greater photosynthetic capacity and leaf N concentration, and lower carbon-to-N ratio and root-to-shoot ratio, which conferred it the greater performance. Moreover, across the light gradient, R. pseudoacacia showed higher correlations between photosynthetic capacity and other functional traits than S. japonica. In contrast, N deposition showed little impact on our experiment. Our results suggested that across light regimes, three aspects of functional traits contributed to the superior performance of R. pseudoacacia: functional trait divergence, significantly different plasticity of these traits, as well as greater overall trait coordination.","[Luo, Yujie; Wang, Renqing; Du, Ning; Guo, Weihua] Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yujie; Wang, Renqing; Du, Ning; Guo, Weihua] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Yifu] Shandong Agr Univ, Sch Forestry, 61 Daizong St, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian] Shandong Univ, Inst Environm Res, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China","Guo, WH (reprint author), Shandong Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.; Guo, WH (reprint author), Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",guo_wh@yahoo.com,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270374, 31470402, 31400173]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2011FY110300]","National Science Foundation of China (Nos 31270374, 31470402, 31400173); Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No. 2011FY110300).",,67,5,5,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2016,36,3,,,,,345,355,,10.1093/treephys/tpv123,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,DI0JE,WOS:000373181100008,26655381,"Green Published, Bronze",,,10/31/19J,"Sykorova, Z; Rydlova, J; Slavikova, R; Ness, T; Kohout, P; Puschel, D",,,,"Sykorova, Zuzana; Rydlova, Jana; Slavikova, Renata; Ness, Tara; Kohout, Petr; Pueschel, David",,,Forest reclamation of fly ash deposit: a field study on appraisal of mycorrhizal inoculation,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; ectomycorrhiza; inoculum tracing; molecular methods,FUNGUS LACTARIUS-DELICIOSUS; EXTRARADICAL MYCELIUM; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANTS; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; ESTABLISHMENT; REVEGETATION; COLONIZATION; SEEDLINGS,"An extensive field trial was established on a fly ash deposit (1) to evaluate whether the inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and/or ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) improves growth and survival of 13 planted tree species and (2) to trace the inoculated mycorrhizal fungi in tree roots after one growing season. Molecular methods were applied to characterize AMF and EcMF entering the studied system (inocula, native soil, and roots of nursery seedlings). Biometric parameters and mortality of the trees were recorded and the presence of AMF and EcMF in sampled trees was determined both microscopically and genetically. Mycorrhizal inoculation did not improve survival or growth of any tree species. Most AMF-host and all EcMF-host seedlings were highly precolonized already from the nursery. An abundant and diverse AMF community was also found in the field soil. The AMF inoculum taxa partially overlapped with AMF in the native soil and in the precolonized roots. After one season, the only two inoculum-unique AMF taxa were detected in host species non-precolonized or only partially precolonized from the nursery. The components of EcMF inoculum were not detected in any sampled tree. After the season, the ectomycorrhizal hosts maintained most of their original EcMF taxa gathered in nursery, some tree species were additionally colonized by EcMF probably originating from the soil. Our results show considerable self-restoration potential of nature on the target site. Mycorrhizal inoculation thus did not bring any conclusive advantage to the planted trees and seems superfluous for reclamation practice on the fly ash deposit.","[Sykorova, Zuzana; Rydlova, Jana; Slavikova, Renata; Ness, Tara; Kohout, Petr; Pueschel, David] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Slavikova, Renata; Pueschel, David] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Microbiol, Videnska 1083, CR-14220 Prague 4, Kre, Czech Republic; [Ness, Tara] 4718,11th Ave NE Apt 16, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Sykorova, Z (reprint author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",zuzana.sykorova@ibot.cas.cz,"Puschel, David/G-3085-2014; Kohout, Petr/B-4975-2011; Kolarikova, Zuzana/C-3558-2009","Kohout, Petr/0000-0002-3985-2310; ","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [1M0571]; Czech Sciences FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P504/10/P021]; long-term research development project (RVO) [67985939]","We acknowledge the contribution of V.

Changes in the soil microbial community generated by invasive plants contribute to seedling failure. A method to remediate invasive species-induced changes to the soil microbial community that results in increased native species seedling performance and decreased invasive species seedling performance could have a large impact on the success of many restoration efforts. In a greenhouse experiment, we first examined the changes in the soil microbial community created by invasive compared to native grasses. Then, we investigated four microbial treatments (bacterial inoculant, fungal inoculant, fungicide, and bactericide/fungicide) to remediate microbial plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) created by invasive species Bromus inermis and Poa pratensis and increase the performance of natives Andropogon gerardii, Elymus canadensis, Pascopyrum smithii, and Schizachyrium scoparium. We found that the PSF mitigation treatments had some context-dependent utility for restoration. For example, all of the treatments decreased the performance of B. inermis and fungal inoculant decreased the performance of P. pratensis. However, no single treatment increased the performance of all natives. Fungicide increased the performance of A. gerardii and E. canadensis in soil previously occupied by B. inermis and the performance of S. scoparium in soil previously occupied by P. pratensis. If validated in the field, PSF mitigation treatments may have utility for restoration practitioners.","[Perkins, Lora B.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Hatfield, Gary] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Perkins, LB (reprint author), S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",perkinslb@gmail.com,"Perkins, Lora B/C-3329-2016","Perkins, Lora B/0000-0002-0689-4995",Agricultural Research Station at South Dakota State University,This work was supported by the Agricultural Research Station at South Dakota State University.

We, hence, studied temporal variation in fine root production and turnover in an old forest. Fine root dynamics were investigated, using sequential soil cores for 6 years, and related to rainfall and air temperature in a mixed mature broad-leaved Pinus koraiensis forest in northeastern China. The mass, production, mortality, and disappearance of fine roots showed intra-annual variation. Monthly live and dead fine root mass were significantly positively correlated with meteorological conditions of the previous month. Monthly fine root production was associated with air temperature of the current month. The intra-annual pattern of fine root production was similar to that of net primary production and opposite to that of leaf litterfall. Total fine root production accounted for 25 % of net primary production, and the fine root input to soil carbon was 1.2 times larger than the leaf litterfall. Our results indicate tight linkages between fine roots and meteorological conditions. The important role of fine roots in forest carbon budget suggests that forest carbon flux estimations need to take fine root dynamics into account.","[Wang, Cunguo] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China; [Wang, Cunguo; Han, Shijie; Zhang, Junhui; Li, Mai-He] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yumei] Shanghai Inst Technol, Shanghai 201418, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junhui; Zheng, Xingbo; Dai, Guanhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Stn Changbai Mt Forest Ecosyst, Antu 133613, Peoples R China","Han, SJ (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, State Key Lab Forest & Soil Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",hansj@iae.ac.cn,"Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050201, XDA05020300]; State Key Program of National Natural Science of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41330530]; State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology [LFSE2013-01]","Financial support was obtained from the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA05050201, XDA05020300), the State Key Program of National Natural Science of China ( Grant No. 41330530), and the State Key Laboratory of Forest and Soil Ecology ( Grant No. LFSE2013-01).

A rhizobox experiment was conducted with poplars, where the plant stem cuttings were grown in contaminated technosols for 2 months under glasshouse conditions. After plant growth, rhizosphere and bulk soil pore water (SPW) were sampled together. SPW properties such as pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd were determined. The concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd in plant organs were also determined. Rhizosphere SPW pH increased for all studied soils by 0.3 to 0.6 units compared to bulk soils. A significant increase was also observed for DOC concentrations regardless of the soil type or total metal concentrations, which might be attributed to the plant root activity. For all studied soils, the rhizosphere SPW metal concentrations decreased significantly after plant growth compared to bulk soils which might be attributed to the increase in pH and effects of root exudates. Zn, Pb and Cd accumulated in plant organs and the higher metal concentrations were found in plant roots compared to plant shoots. The restricted transfer of the studied metals to the plant shoots confirms the potential role of this species in the immobilization of these metals. Thus, P. euramericana Dorskamp can be used for phytostabilization of technosols.","[Qasim, Bashar; Motelica-Heino, Mikael] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7327, ISTO, Campus Geosci, Orleans, France; [Qasim, Bashar] Univ Technol Baghdad, Dept Appl Sci, Baghdad, Iraq; [Bourgerie, Sylvain; Morabito, Domenico] Univ Orleans, INRA USC1328, LBLGC EA 1207, Orleans, France; [Gauthier, Arnaud] Univ Lille 1, LGCgE, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France","Qasim, B (reprint author), Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7327, ISTO, Campus Geosci, Orleans, France.; Qasim, B (reprint author), Univ Technol Baghdad, Dept Appl Sci, Baghdad, Iraq.",bhq_chem@yahoo.com,,"QASIM, Bashar/0000-0001-9115-5590","Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Baghdad, Iraq)","The authors wish to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Baghdad, Iraq) for their financial support and are grateful to Florie Miard (Laboratoire de Biologie des Ligneux et des Grandes Cultures (LBLGG), Orleans, France) for their excellent technical assistance.",,73,11,12,1,44,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-0108,1614-7480,,J SOIL SEDIMENT,J.

Among the Australian mammals, mycophagy is most prevalent within the Potoroidae (bettongs and potoroos). However, proportionally more species of Potoroidae are either recently extinct or currently threatened than any other mammalian family in Australia, and they are among the least studied. The critically endangered woylie, or brush-tailed bettong (Bettongia penicillata), is a mycophagous, ground dwelling 'ecosystem engineer' that was one of Australia's most abundant and widely distributed potoroids prior to European settlement. After substantial range contraction, however, the remaining indigenous populations are now restricted to eucalypt forests in south-western Australia. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the population responses of the woylie to timber harvesting in these forests. Nine treatments, including varying logging intensities and unharvested controls, were applied at 22 sites. The abundance of the woylie in the harvested areas, in unharvested stands between logged areas, and in extensive unharvested stands outside the harvest management area were compared using a replicated before-after-control-impact (BACI) repeated measures design and capture mark -recapture modelling. A total of 5860 captures of 815 individuals were recorded during 35 trapping sessions over 16 years (one year preceding, two years during, and 13 years after disturbance). Capture rate was a good index of abundance for this species and woylie abundance, survivorship and recruitment were not adversely affected by silvicultural practices in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest. On the contrary, the harvested areas may have afforded some localised protection when an unrelated, species wide decline began three years after harvesting disturbance ended; woylie numbers declined by up to 77% and 95% in harvested and unharvested areas, respectively. Thus the nature and spatial extent of the timber harvesting regimes investigated in this study were not a major threatening process for this species. However, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that timber harvesting activities remain benign in the face of a changing climate, possible increased mortality from introduced predators, disease, and further declines in the abundance of this critically endangered marsupial.

A hypothetical root-to-shoot (R:S) imbalance provoked by historical coppicing is investigated as the underlying driver of stand degradation. After stem genotyping, 12 stems belonging to two clones covering 81 and 16 m2 were harvested and excavated to measure above- and below ground biomass and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) pools. To study root system functionality, root connections and root longevity were assessed by radiocarbon analysis. Seasonality of NSC was monitored on five additional clones. NSC pools, R:S biomass ratio and fine roots-to-foliage ratio were higher in the large clone, whose centennial root system, estimated to be 550 years old, maintained large amounts of sapwood (51.8%) for NSC storage. 248 root connections were observed within the large clone, whereas the small clone showed comparatively simpler root structure (26 connections). NSC concentrations were higher in spring (before bud burst) and autumn (before leaf fall), and lower in summer (after complete leaf expansion); they were always higher in roots than in stems or twigs. The persistence of massive and highly inter-connected root systems after coppicing may lead to increasing R:S biomass ratios and root NSC pools over time. We highlight the need of surveying belowground organs to understand aboveground dynamics of Q. pyrenaica, and suggest that enhanced belowground NSC storage and consumption reflect a trade-off between clonal vegetative resilience and aboveground performance.

This study reports on projected carbon losses due to the assumed local climate change-driven extinction of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) from Zala County, South-Western Hungary, where the species grows at the xeric limit of its distribution. The losses were calculated as a difference between carbon stocks in climate change scenarios assuming an exponentially increasing forest decline over time, and those in a baseline scenario assuming no climate change. In the climate change scenarios, three different sets of forest management adaptation measures were studied: (1) only harvesting damaged stands, (2) additionally salvaging dead trees that died due to climate change, and (3) replacing, at an increasing rate over time, beech with sessile oak (Quercus petraea Matt. Lieb.) after final harvest. Projections were made using the open access carbon accounting model CASMOFOR based on modeling or assuming effects of climate change on mortality, tree growth, root-to-shoot ratio and decomposition rates. Results demonstrate that, if beech disappears from the region as projected by the end of the century, over 80% of above-ground biomass carbon, and over 60% of the carbon stocks of all pools (excluding soils) of the forests will be lost by 2100. Such emission rates on large areas may have a discernible positive feedback on climate change, and can only partially be offset by the forest management adaptation measures.","[Somogyi, Zoltan] Natl Agr Res & Innovat Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Frankel L U 1, H-1027 Budapest, Hungary","Somogyi, Z (reprint author), Natl Agr Res & Innovat Ctr, Forest Res Inst, Frankel L U 1, H-1027 Budapest, Hungary.",somogyiz@iif.hu,,, [Tamop-22A-11/1/KONV-2012-0013 'Agrarklima'],This research was supported by the Tamop-22A-11/1/KONV-2012-0013 'Agrarklima' research project.,,76,2,2,0,0,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2454-034X,2454-0358,,CENT EURO FOR J,Cent.

However, this is not always the case. This review examines the processes and stand structural attributes that can influence diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs); how they influence resource availability, resource uptake, and resource-use efficiency; and also describes some important differences between tree-diversity versus grassland-diversity experiments. The size of the complementarity effects caused by these processes and stand structures varies along spatial and temporal gradients in resource availability and climate. These spatial and temporal dynamics have now been examined in many studies, and the general patterns are summarized using a simple framework; complementarity is predicted to increase as the availability of resource '' X '' declines (or climatic condition X becomes harsher) if the species interactions improve the availability, uptake, or use efficiency of resource X (or interactions improve climatic condition X). Importantly, this framework differs from the stress-gradient hypothesis to account for a wider range of inter-specific plant interactions (not only facilitation) by considering contrasting methods used to quantify species interactions while accounting for stand structure. In addition, complementarity (as opposed to facilitation) for a given species combination can increase as growing conditions improve in forests, contrary to predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis with regards to facilitation. This review indicates that while the effects of tree-species diversity on growth and other forest functions are now receiving a lot of attention, far less is known about the effects of structural diversity on growth or forest functioning. Direct measurements of the processes, as opposed to focusing mainly on growth responses, could greatly contribute to our understanding of structural diversity effects.","[Forrester, David I.; Bauhus, Jrgen] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany","Forrester, DI (reprint author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany.",david.forrester@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de; juergen.bauhus@waldbau.uni-freiburg.de,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013; Forrester, David I/L-5351-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986; ","Heisenberg FellowshipGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FO 791/4-1]; German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [BA 2821/14-3]","D.

These changes to AMF can cascade to affect plant communities and vertebrate populations. Despite these research advances, relatively little is known about (1) the mechanisms behind earthworms' effects on AMF and (2) the factors that determine the outcomes of earthworm-AMF interactions (i.e., whether AMF abundance is increased or decreased and subsequent effects on plants). We predict that AMF-mediated effects of nonnative earthworms on ecosystems are nearly universal because (1) AMF are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems, (2) nonnative earthworms have become established in nearly every type of terrestrial ecosystem, and (3) nonnative earthworms, due to their burrowing and feeding behavior, greatly affect AMF with potentially profound concomitant effects on plant communities. We highlight the multiple direct and indirect effects of nonnative earthworms on plants and review what is currently known about the interaction between earthworms and AMF. We also illustrate how the effects of nonnative earthworms on plant-AMF mutualisms can alter the structure and stability of aboveground plant communities, as well as the vertebrate communities relying on these habitats. Integrative studies that assess the interactive effects of earthworms and AMF can provide new insights into the role that belowground ecosystem engineers play in altering aboveground ecological processes. Understanding these processes may improve our ability to predict the structure of plant and animal communities in earthworm-invaded regions and to develop management strategies that limit the numerous undesired impacts of earthworms.","[Paudel, Shishir; Wilson, Gail W.

Bacterial mutualists in particular might evolve quickly, thanks to short generation times and the potential for independent evolution of plasmids through recombination and/or HGT (horizontal gene transfer). In a previous work using the legume/rhizobia mutualism, we demonstrated that long-term nitrogen fertilization caused the evolution of less-mutualistic rhizobia. Here, we use our 63 previously isolated rhizobium strains in comparative phylogenetic and quantitative genetic analyses to determine the degree to which variation in partner quality is attributable to phylogenetic relationships among strains versus recent genetic changes in response to N fertilization. We find evidence of distinct evolutionary relationships between chromosomal and pSym genes, and broad similarity between pSym genes. We also find that nifD has a unique evolutionary history that explains much of the variation in partner quality, and suggest MoFe subunit interaction sites in the evolution of less-mutualistic rhizobia. These results provide insight into the mechanisms behind the evolutionary response of rhizobia to long-term N fertilization, and we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of the mutualism.","[Gordon, Benjamin R.; Klinger, Christie R.; Burke, Patricia V.; Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Weese, Dylan J.] St Ambrose Univ, Dept Biol, 518 West Locust St, Davenport, IA 52803 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Dentinger, Bryn T.

The biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen (N) in soil is complex, consisting of many simultaneously occurring processes. In situ studies investigating the effects of roots and mycorrhizae on gross N turnover rates are scarce. We conducted a N-15 tracer study under field conditions in a spruce forest on organic soil, which was subjected to exclusion of roots and roots plus ectomycorrhizae (ECM) for 6 years by trenching. The forest soil had, over the 6-year period, an average emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) of 5.9 +/- A 2.1 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1). Exclusion of roots + ECM nearly tripled N2O emissions over all years, whereas root exclusion stimulated N2O emission only in the latest years and to a smaller extent. Gross mineralization-ammonium (NH4 (+)) immobilization turnover was enhanced by the presence of roots, probably due to high inputs of labile carbon, stimulating microbial activity. We found contrasting effects of roots and ECM on N2O emission and mineralization, as the former was decreased but the latter was stimulated by roots and ECM. The N2O emission was positively related to the ratio of gross NH4 (+) oxidation (that is, autotrophic nitrification) to NH4 (+) immobilization. Ammonium oxidation was only stimulated by the presence of ECM, but not by the presence of roots. Overall, we conclude that plants and their mycorrhizal symbionts actively control soil N cycling, thereby also affecting N2O emissions from forest soils. Consequently, adapted forest management with permanent tree cover avoiding clearcutting could be a means to reduce N2O emissions and potential N leaching; despite higher mineralization in the presence of roots and ECM, N2O emissions are decreased as the relative importance of NH4 (+) oxidation is decreased, mainly due to a stimulated microbial NH4 (+) immobilization in the mycorrhizosphere.","[Holz, M.; Kuzyakov, Y.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Holz, M.; Kuzyakov, Y.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Soil Sci, Busgenweg 2, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Aurangojeb, M.; Kasimir, A.; Klemedtsson, L.; Rutting, T.] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Box 460, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Boeckx, P.] Univ Ghent, Isotope Biosci Lab ISOFYS, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Rutting, T (reprint author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Box 460, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",tobias.rutting@gu.se,"Kasimir, Asa/Y-8601-2019; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010","Kasimir, Asa/0000-0001-6909-607X; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas; Swedish strategic research area ""Biodiversity and Ecosystem services in a Changing Climate - BECC""","We would like to thank Sami Namasse and Camille Ziegler for assisting in the <SUP>15</SUP>N work, Katja Van Nieuland for assisting in the laboratory work and David Allbrand for N<INF>2</INF>O flux measurements.

This study was conducted to determine trace metal concentrations in soil and different plant parts that grow in the Amin Bazar landfill, Bangladesh, to evaluate the possible human health risk on consumer. The collected soil and plant samples were analyzed for trace metals using a Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The mean concentrations of trace metal found in the soil were in the following order: zinc (Zn) > manganese (Mn )> lead (Pb) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr) > nickel (Ni). Considering all selected plant species, the mean concentrations of trace metals were in the following order: Zn > Ni > Mn> Cu. On the other hand considering all measured trace metals, the accumulation trend in plant species were in the following order: Carica papaya > Enhydra flactuans > Amaranthus gangeticus > Ipomoea aquatica > Sesbania cannabina > Musa sapientum. Pb and Cr were not accumulated in the studied plant species. Translocation factor (TF), bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and bioaccumulation coefficient (BAC) were calculated for the assessment of mobility of trace metals from root to shoot, soil to shoot and soil to whole plant, respectively. TF values showed that the plant species effectively translocate trace metals from roots to the shoots, suggesting that they are suitable for phytoextraction. According to BAF all studied plants were excluders for all metals except Ni, and according to BAC, all studied plants were hyperaccumulators of Ni. The daily metal intake and health risk index values of the studied metals, except of Ni, indicated that there is a relative absence of health risks associated with the ingestion of contaminated edible parts of plants.","[Kamal, Abdul Kadir Ibne; Islam, Md.

The carbon-physiological mechanisms underlying these positive effects of understory management on the growth of overstory trees have received less attention. We studied the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and total nitrogen (N) concentrations in tissues (needles, stem sapwood, and fine roots) of three tree species (two evergreen and one deciduous species) grown in the presence or absence (understory cut) of understory shrubs in plantations in southwestern China, to test whether understories affect the carbon and nitrogen status in the overstory trees. The concentrations of N, NSC (= soluble sugars + starch) in overstory trees varied significantly with understory treatments during the dry season rather than the wet season. Trees grown without understory shrubs had higher levels of N and NSC compared to trees grown with understories. The present study provides insight to explain the functional mechanisms for understory effects on growth of overstory trees, and indicates that the nitrogen and carbon status in overstory trees may be more strongly negatively affected by understory in stressful conditions rather than in optimal growth conditions. Moreover, the present study provides ecophysiology-based knowledge for dealing with understory vegetation management in forest ecosystems.","[Du, Zhong; Bao, Weikai; Chen, Huai; Zhao, Qingxia] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat &, Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Li, Mai-He] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Ecophysiol Grp, Forest Dynam, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Wang, Xue; Jiang, Yong; Li, Mai-He] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Cai, Xiaohu; Pan, Hongli; Liu, Xingliang] Sichuan Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wanze] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazard & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhong] Southwest Univ Nationalities, Inst Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China","Li, MH (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Ecophysiol Grp, Forest Dynam, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.; Li, MH (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",duzhong@cib.ac.cn; waldch@163.com; baowk@cib.ac.cn; chenhuai@cib.ac.cn; panfreely@126.com; wangxue_9045@163.com; zhaoqx@cib.ac.cn; wzzhu@imde.ac.cn; liuxingliang@126.com; jiangyong@iae.ac.cn; maihe.li@wsl.ch,"Jiang, Yong/A-2263-2012; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; Chen, Huai/A-7418-2015","Jiang, Yong/0000-0001-7518-5810; Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Chen, Huai/0000-0001-6208-1481; Du, Zhong/0000-0002-2491-9033","Scientific Research Program on Public Welfare of State Forestry Administration [201104026]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41501227, 40771071]","This study was supported by the Scientific Research Program on Public Welfare of State Forestry Administration (No. 201104026 to Cai Xiaohu) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41501227 to Du Zhong; No. 40771071 to Li Mai-He).

Multiple assembly processes, including abiotic filtering, competition and multi-trophic relationships, operate simultaneously to structure FD. In water-limited plant communities, FD is likely to reflect trade-offs between drought resistance vs. disturbance resistance and competitive ability. We propose a mathematical mechanistic model for understanding the organization and function of water-limited plant communities. The approach captures the interplay between abiotic filtering, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance. We exploit this powerful model to uncover mechanisms underlying changes in functional diversity along stress gradients. Our approach links biomass production and FD to environmental conditions through plant resource capture ability. Functional groups are defined along a single trade-off axis according to investment in capturing light (shoot) vs. water (root). Species growth rate is determined dynamically by the species traits, water availability and grazing stress. We derive biomass production, functional diversity and composition along precipitation and grazing gradients. Model's results revealed several regimes structuring FD along the precipitation gradient: Struggle for water' at low precipitation, competition for water' at intermediate precipitation and competition for light' at high precipitation. We observed a shift in grazing effect on FD from negative at very low precipitation, to positive at higher precipitation. Unimodal FD-grazing intensity relationship was observed under high precipitation, while under low precipitation, FD decreased moderately with increasing grazing intensity.Synthesis. Our model showcases how fundamental tradeoffs in plant traits may drive functional diversity and ecosystem function along environmental gradients. It offers a mechanism through which novel understandings can be obtained regarding the interplay between water stress, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance intensity and history. We discuss further model testing possibilities as well as required empirical work.","[Nathan, Jonathan; Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Volcani Ctr, ARO, Dept Nat Resources, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel","Meron, E (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.; Meron, E (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel.",meron@bgu.ac.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [861/09],"This research has been supported by the Israel Science Foundation, Grant no. 861/09.",,87,14,15,6,110,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We measured the mass and decomposition of fine root detritus in three mangrove forests along an intertidal gradient in tropical Australia to provide the first integrated estimates of the rate of turnover of fine root detritus. The grand mean dry masses of dead fine roots in the forests decreased in the order mid-intertidal Rhizophora (mean 28.4 kg m(-2)), low-intertidal Rhizophora (16.3 kg m(-2)) and high-intertidal Ceriops (mean 8.9 kg m(-2)), and were some of the highest on record. The first-order decay coefficients (day(-1)) for dead fine roots in the low Rhizophora, mid Rhizophora and high Ceriops forest sites were 0.0014, 0.0017 and 0.0007, respectively, and were the lowest on record. The estimated mean fluxes of C via decomposition of dead fine roots were very high in all forests, decreasing in the order mid Rhizophora (18.8 g C m(-2) day(-1)), low Rhizophora (8.4 g C m(-2) day(-1)) and high Ceriops (2.5 g C m(-2) day(-1)). There were relatively low levels of uncertainty in these estimates when all sources of error were considered. The fluxes of C for the two Rhizophora sites integrate all losses from saprophytic decay and leaching of dissolved C and were 50-200 % higher than the estimated total annual loss of C derived by summing rates of bacterial metabolism and export via groundwater and surface waters in these forests. The significant difference reflects both the very high dead root masses and the incorporation of the impact of fungi in our estimates.","[Robertson, Alistar I.; Alongi, Daniel M.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Robertson, Alistar I.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Robertson, Alistar I.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Robertson, AI (reprint author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.; Robertson, AI (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Robertson, AI (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",Alistar.Robertson@uwa.edu.au,,,,,,51,10,11,6,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2016,180,3,,,,,841,851,,10.1007/s00442-015-3506-0,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DF8VB,WOS:000371637000019,26581419,,,,10/31/19J,"Snell, HSK; Robinson, D; Midwood, AJ",,,,"Snell, Helen S.

We used natural abundance C-13 to partition soil-surface CO2 efflux into root and SOM sources. CO2 was sampled from incubated root-free soil and from live tree roots using in-situ chambers. Combined surface efflux delta(CO2)-C-13 was measured using dynamic chambers and cavity-ringdown spectroscopy. Under Sycamore, CO2 emissions were dominated (80-90 %) by root respiration. SOM contributed 10-20 % with a mean residence time of centuries. Under Larch, 24-33 % of total CO2 efflux was root respiration, the remainder originating from an SOM pool with a turnover time of decades. Total soil C stocks were similar between the two plot types. Root-respired delta(CO2)-C-13 was consistently different by c. 2 aEuro degrees between the species. The decomposition rate of soil C and its mean residence time are markedly different under the two tree species.

In contrast, the fungal energy channel is assumed to be controlled by arthropods and mycophagous nematodes. This perspective accepted by most soil biologists is, however, challenged by functional studies conducted by taxonomists that revealed a range of mycophagous protists. In order to increase the knowledge on the functional importance of mycophagous protists we isolated and initiated cultures of protist taxa and tested eight for facultative feeding on diverse fungi in microcosm experiments. Two different flagellate species of the genus Cercomonas, the testate amoeba Cryptodifflugia operculata and four genera of naked amoebae (Acanthamoeba sp., Leptomyxa sp., two Mayorella spp. and Thecamoeba spp.) fed and grew on yeasts with four taxa (Cercomonas sp., Leptomyxa sp., Mayorella sp., and Thecamoeba sp.) also thriving on spores of the plant pathogenic hyphal-forming fungus Fusarium culmorum. To identify the potential importance of mycophagous protists in the environment we applied a data mining approach targeting small subunit (SSU) rRNA data obtained in metatranscriptomes of five fundamentally different terrestrial samples. We focused our analyses on the distribution and relative abundances of two well-studied mycophagous protist groups, vampyrellid amoebae and grossglockneriid ciliates. Both groups were detected in all of the highly contrasting terrestrial samples, comprising up to 3% of all protist SSU rRNA transcripts. SSU transcripts of these two groups, in contrast to all remaining protist SSU transcripts, showed strong correlations with the relative abundance of fungal sequences indicating close direct trophic interactions. Taken together, this study provides evidence that mycophagy among soil protists is common and might be of substantial but hitherto overlooked ecological importance in terrestrial ecosystems.

Moreover, due to high variability, ITS sequences cannot be used for phylogenetic analyses of unrelated taxa. The part of single-copy gene encoding the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) was thus compared with first spacer of ITS as an alternative marker for the analysis of fungal communities in spruce forest topsoil, and their applicability was tested on a comprehensive mock community. In soil, rpb2 exhibited broad taxonomic coverage of the entire fungal tree of life including basal fungal lineages. The gene exhibited sufficient variation for the use in phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic assignments, although it amplifies also paralogues. The fungal taxon spectra obtained with rbp2 region and ITS1 corresponded, but sequence abundance differed widely, especially in the basal lineages. The proportions of OTU counts and read counts of major fungal groups were close to the reality when rpb2 was used as a molecular marker while they were strongly biased towards the Basidiomycota when using the ITS primers ITS1/ITS4. Although the taxonomic placement of rbp2 sequences is currently more difficult than that of the ITS sequences, its discriminative power, quantitative representation of community composition and suitability for phylogenetic analyses represent significant advantages.","[Vetrovsky, Tomas; Kolarik, Miroslav; Zifcakova, Lucia; Zelenka, Tomas; Baldrian, Petr] ASCR, Inst Microbiol, Vvi, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic","Baldrian, P (reprint author), ASCR, Inst Microbiol, Vvi, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220 4, Czech Republic.",baldrian@biomed.cas.cz,"Zelenka, Tomas/F-2402-2015; Vetrovsky, Tomas/R-5817-2017; Kolarik, Miroslav/A-1680-2008; Baldrian, Petr/A-9170-2009","Zelenka, Tomas/0000-0003-2753-9754; Kolarik, Miroslav/0000-0003-4016-0335; Baldrian, Petr/0000-0002-8983-2721","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-06763S, P504/12/0709]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LD12050]; Research concept of the Institute of Microbiology ASCR [RVO61388971]","This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (13-06763S, P504/12/0709), the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (LD12050), and by the Research concept of the Institute of Microbiology ASCR (RVO61388971).",,60,21,23,1,43,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-098X,1755-0998,,MOL ECOL RESOUR,Mol.

Two clones of the pseudometallophyte Agrostis capillaris, one originating from a HM-contaminated site (PH) and one from an uncontaminated site (NC), were grown along a gradient of polymetallic contamination and either inoculated or not with an HM-tolerant AM fungal strain of Rhizophagus irregularis. Plant growth and chlorophyll concentrations decreased with rising substrate contamination much more in the NC clone. This HM-sensitive clone also accumulated significantly more Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu in its shoots when grown in the contaminated substrates. Contrary to our hypothesis, these marked inter-clonal differences little affected the outcome of the interaction of A. capillaris with AM fungi along the contamination gradient. Inoculated plants showed generally higher chlorophyll concentrations and a lower carotenoids/chlorophyll ratio. The rise in the chlorophyll a/b ratio due to the AM inoculation in the most contaminated substrate indicated a role of AM fungi in the alleviation of intense HM-induced oxidative stress. The AM inoculation also increased plant P concentrations, especially in the roots, but this influence diminished with rising contamination. These promotional effects of the AM inoculation were, however, not reflected in plant growth, and inoculated plants showed unchanged or even reduced shoot dry weight. The impact of AM fungi on HM uptake and root-to-shoot translocation depended on the contamination level, clone and particular metal, without any significant effect recorded in the contaminated substrates for Pb, which was the main contaminant. In spite of evidencing certain positive effects of AM fungi on the physiological state of their hosts, our data provide little support for AM inoculation as an economically feasible strategy for A. capillaris-based revegetation of HM-contaminated sites.

As mostly stands on seasonally or permanently water-saturated soils were damaged, we hypothesized that the recorded foliar damage might be associated with belowground factors. We established 48 sample plots in stands with damage symptoms for soil parameter evaluation and fine root sampling to determine the number of fine roots in different growth stages and to describe the associated fungal community. Among sample plots on organic soils, there were fewer viable older fine roots and greater number of dead fine roots in more damaged sites than in less damaged. These root parameters were significantly correlated with higher groundwater level and soil pH. The fungal community was dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) species (the most common was Tylospora asterophora), the endophyte Oidiodendron maius and saprotrophic species Cryptococcus magnus. Saprotrophic species had higher abundance in more damaged sites, suggesting a shift in fungal communities from ECM fungi. In conclusion, the results of this work suggest Norway spruce root system response to short-term climatic stress, which should be considered when planning spruce forest management, especially on organic soils with a high groundwater level.","[Klavina, Darta; Gaitnieks, Talis; Lazdins, Andis] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Rigas 111, LV-2169 Salaspils, Latvia; [Menkis, Audrius] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala BioCtr, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Gaitnieks, Talis] SIA MNKC, Forest Sect Competence Ctr, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia; [Velmala, Sannakajsa; Rajala, Tiina; Pennanen, Taina] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Biobased Business & Ind, Novel Prod Serv & Technol, Vantaa 01370, Finland","Klavina, D (reprint author), Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Rigas 111, LV-2169 Salaspils, Latvia.",darta.klavina@silava.lv,"; Lazdins, Andis/E-8366-2013","Velmala, Sannakajsa/0000-0001-9813-9825; Lazdins, Andis/0000-0002-7169-2011","JSC ""Latvian State Forests"" ERDF Project ""Methods and technologies for increasing forest capital value"", Ltd.

We examined above and belowground growth and productivity of four tree species - eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and loblolly pine (Pious taeda) - receiving irrigation and fertilization in the Upper Coastal Plain ecoregion of South Carolina, USA. Trees received treatments throughout an entire intensively-managed harvest rotation, which was nine years for cottonwood and sycamore, and 11 years for sweetgum and loblolly pine. Fertilization and irrigation positively affected growth and productivity of all tree species. Fertilization alone led to increases in stem volume index of up to 329% for cottonwood, 376% for sycamore, 261% for sweetgum, and 49% for loblolly pine. Loblolly pine grew the largest of all species tested, and sweetgum was the largest hardwood. Net primary productivity was driven by leaf and fine root tissue production. When accounting for the effect of tree size, belowground biomass decreased with increasing resource availability in sweetgum and loblolly pine, but not cottonwood or sycamore. These results help explain complex relationships between above and belowground tissues in woody species, and indicate that both ontogeny and resource availability can mediate allocation to belowground tissues.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of individual trees and their root system on the spatial distribution and chemical composition of SOM fractions and the storage of SOC in subsoils. A Dystric Cambisol was sampled along three vertical replicate transects (3.15 m in length, 2.00 m in depth) in a regular grid (45 cm horizontal spaces, 25 cm vertical spaces) at increasing distance from three individual mature European beech trees (Fagas sylvatica L.). Soil OM fractions were obtained from rhizosphere soil and bulk soil samples taken at 10 and 85 cm depth increments by a combined density and particle size fractionation. Carbon and nitrogen measurements were performed, and the chemical composition of the SOM fractions was further characterized by solid state cross polarization magic angle spinning C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The distance from the individual trees had no influence on the SOC contents and stocks or the chemical composition of the SOM fractions. This was ascribed to the dense and even rooting at 0-40 cm depth across all sampled distances. Instead, the SOC contents and stocks highly differed between 10 cm depth (11.4 g SOC kg(-1)), where particulate organic matter (POM) dominated, and 85 cm depth (0.5 g SOC kg(-1)), where clay associated SOC dominated. These differences seemed to be strongly influenced by the roots of the trees which were almost completely absent from depths >= 60 cm. Elevated SOC contents in the rhizosphere soil (40.1 g SOC kg(-1)) were ascribed to root exudates in the root's vicinity and a very high amount (109.3 g kg(-1)) of fresh POM (allcy1/0/N alkyl C ratio of 0.8). The data revealed that, besides root exudates, also root derived POM contributed significant amounts of SOC to the soil. Although only low amounts of the clay fraction were found at 85 cm depth (22.8 g clay kg(-1)), it accounted for high amounts of SOC and played a crucial role for the storage of SOM. The relatively high SOC stocks at 40-200 cm depth (1.4 kg C m(-2)) compared to the SOC stocks at 0-40 cm depth (3.8 kg C m(-2)) indicate that also sandy forest subsoils with low SOC contents have to be considered in terrestrial carbon inventories.

When ecological processes change or a species' range is heavily fragmented, it may be difficult to determine microsite characteristics needed for a successful reintroduction. In such cases, experimental reintroductions can be used to learn more about the species' reproductive niche while establishing new self-sustaining populations. We reintroduced the Florida endangered species, Tephrosia angustissima var. corallicola, to examine native microsite requirements and feasibility of reintroduction into nearby suitable habitat. We transplanted Tephrosia into three microsites with varying light and substrate and characterized their wet and dry season soil moisture, soil bulk density, and light conditions. We monitored transplant and recruited seedling growth, reproduction, and survival and seedling germination in each microsite for 6 years. The microsite supporting greatest survival changed across developmental stages and time. Although no original transplants survived to 2009, the reintroduced population persists in 2015 through recruitment. Highest recruit growth, flowering, and survival occurred in shady, dry microsites. Recruits germinated more in the wettest microsite, reproduced most in the driest, and persisted longest in the wettest. Recruits germinated in shadier locations than where adults were planted. Although assessing whether a reintroduction is self-sustaining will require decades of monitoring, this experimental reintroduction elucidated the necessity for heterogeneous microsites at recipient sites and the efficacy of planting reproductive individuals for rapid next generation recruitment. Determining appropriate microsites for species requiring human assisted migration may also benefit from these techniques.","[Wendelberger, Kristie S.] Florida Int Univ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Maschinski, Joyce] Kushlan Trop Sci Inst, Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, 11935 Old Cutler Rd, Miami, FL 33156 USA","Wendelberger, KS (reprint author), Florida Int Univ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",kwendelberger@yahoo.com,,,Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services; University of North Carolina's W.C.

The objective of this study was to use deep ( 60 cm) root exclusion tubes and paired control ( i. e., no root exclusion) collars to estimate heterotrophic respiration ( Rh) and Rs, respectively, in three 26- year- old longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris Mill.) stands in western Georgia. Root biomass was measured in root exclusion tubes and control collars after 102-104 days of incubation and fine root biomass loss from root exclusion was used to quantify root decay. Mean Rs from control collars was 3.3 micromol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Root exclusion tubes decreased Rs, providing an estimate of Rh. Mean Rh was 2.7 micromol CO2 m-2 s(-1) when uncorrected by pretreatment variation, root decay, or soil moisture compared to 2.1 micromol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) when Rh was corrected for root decay. The corresponding ratio of Rh to Rs ranged from 66% to 82%, depending on the estimation method. This study provides an estimate of Rh in longleaf pine forests, and demonstrates the potential for deep root exclusion tubes to provide relatively rapid assessments ( i. e., similar to 40 days post- treatment) of Rh in similar forests. The range in Rh to Rs is comparable to other reports for similar temperate coniferous ecosystems.","[ArchMiller, Althea A.; Samuelson, Lisa J.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, 3301 Duncan Dr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [ArchMiller, Althea A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 2003 Upper Buford Circle,Skok Hall 135, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","ArchMiller, AA (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, 3301 Duncan Dr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; ArchMiller, AA (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, 2003 Upper Buford Circle,Skok Hall 135, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",althea.archmiller@gmail.com,,"ArchMiller, Althea/0000-0003-1927-0783","USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2011-68002-30185]; School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama","This research was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Award #2011-68002-30185 and by the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama.

Wilson) forest in a transitional area located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Over the first year of litter decomposition, the litter exhibited absolute cellulose loss and absolute lignin accumulation except for the red birch litter. The changes in litter cellulose and lignin were significantly affected by the interactions among gap position, period and species. Litter cellulose exhibited a greater loss in the winter with the highest daily loss rate observed during the snow cover period. Both cellulose and lignin exhibited greater changes under the deep snow cover at the gap center in the winter, but the opposite pattern occurred under the closed canopy in the growing season. The results suggest that decreased snowpack seasonality due to winter warming may limit litter cellulose and lignin degradation in alpine forest ecosystems, which could further inhibit litter decomposition. As a result, the ongoing winter warming and gap vanishing would slow soil carbon sequestration from foliar litter in cold biomes.","[Li, Han; Wu, Fuzhong; Yang, Wanqin; Xu, Liya; Ni, Xiangyin; He, Jie; Tan, Bo; Hu, Yi] Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol & Forestry, Long Term Res Stn Alpine Forest Ecosyst, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Wu, Fuzhong; Yang, Wanqin; Tan, Bo] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ecol Secur Upper Reaches Y, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China","Yang, WQ (reprint author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Inst Ecol & Forestry, Long Term Res Stn Alpine Forest Ecosyst, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.; Yang, WQ (reprint author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ecol Secur Upper Reaches Y, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",hannahlisc@163.com; wufzchina@163.com; scyangwq@163.com; lihannah@163.com; nixiangyin_922@163.com; lihannah@126.com; bobotan1984@163.com; 13803692816@163.com,,"Ni, Xiangyin/0000-0002-2507-3463","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31270498, 31570445, 31500509]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Special Funding [2012T50782]","We are very grateful to Wei He for helping with the laboratory analysis.

Although this idea is widely found in the literature, recent studies have called this biogeographic pattern into question. We sought to evaluate the LHDH in a high-latitude terrestrial ecosystem where fire and mammalian herbivores may contribute to selection for higher levels of defensive chemistry. To address this objective, we collected seeds of Alaska paper birch (Betula neoalaskana) from nine locations along two north-south transects between 55 degrees N and 62 degrees N latitudes in western, interior Canada. The birch seeds were planted in pots in a common garden in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. From the resulting seedlings, we determined levels of chemical defense by assessing the density of resin glands, which have been shown to be negatively correlated with browsing. To assess plant architectural traits such as height, mean individual leaf area, and root-to-shoot ratio, we harvested a subset of the birch seedlings. Further, we used these traits to examine growth-defense trade-offs. Contrary to the LHDH, we found a positive correlation between chemical defense and latitude. Investigating relationships with fire, we found a strong positive correlation between resin gland density and percentage of area annually burned (PAAB) around each collection location and also between PAAB and latitude. Additionally, birch seedlings originating from higher latitudes were shorter, smaller-leaved, and rootier than their lower-latitude counterparts. Growth-defense trade-offs were observed in negative correlations between resin gland density and height and leaf size. Seedlings with higher resin gland densities also allocated less biomass to shoots and more to roots. These results further call into question the LHDH and provide specific information about latitudinal trends in plant defense at high, northern latitudes where fire is a major ecosystem driver and mammals are the main herbivores of deciduous trees such as birches. We propose that these interconnected relationships are the key drivers of the positive correlation between defense and latitude in B. neoalaskana. Understanding patterns of boreal plant defense and growth is especially important because high latitude ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change.","[Stevens, Michael T.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Brown, Sarah C.; Bothwell, Helen M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Bryant, John P.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Stevens, Michael T.] Utah Valley Univ, Dept Biol, Orem, UT 84058 USA; [Bothwell, Helen M.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Stevens, MT (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Stevens, MT (reprint author), Utah Valley Univ, Dept Biol, Orem, UT 84058 USA.",michael.stevens@uvu.edu,,"Bothwell, Helen/0000-0003-0916-8355; Stevens, Michael/0000-0003-3267-2285",STAR (Science To Achieve Results) Fellowship from Environmental Protection Agency; Hilldale Undergraduate/Faculty Research Fellowship from University of Wisconsin-Madison; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0074424],"We thank the many undergraduate assistants who helped plant and care for the birch seedlings.

Most land restoration practices typically concentrate on the recovery of soil physical properties and plant establishment, while neglecting the recovery of soil microbiota. Mediterranean wild leguminous shrubs are ideal candidates for use in land recovery projects, as they are drought tolerant, improve soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation and exhibit high stem net photosynthesis that increases their carbon gain. In this study, we used the legumes Cytisus balansae, Cytisus multiflorus, Cytisus striatus and Genista florida in a long-term trial to recover a degraded soil in southwestern Spain. The main objective of this trial was to investigate to what extent the introduction of shrubby legumes inoculated with their own rhizobial symbionts can improve the properties and associated vegetation of a degraded soil. The results showed that the inoculation of legumes with nitrogen-fixing bacteria enhanced plant performance in all four legumes. Whereas in the absence of legumes, soil fertility and plant community did not improve significantly, amelioration was observed in plots with non-inoculated legumes, with maximum values in terms of the number of accompanying species, soil nitrogen content and organic matter recorded in soils with inoculated legumes.

The objective of this study was to quantify C storage, net primary production (NPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP) in four major temperate forest types in northeastern China. The four forest types include a primary mixed broadleaf - Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc.) old-growth forest and three mid-aged regenerating forests, i.e., a secondary birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) forest, a Korean pine plantation, and a Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr.) plantation. Total C storage differed significantly among the four forest types, with the highest storage (315.4 t C.ha(-1)) in the old-growth forest. Soil organic C accounted for 55%-70% of the ecosystem C, whereas vegetation C accounted for 28%-43% of the ecosystem C. Soil organic C storage in the two plantations was significantly lower than that in old-growth and secondary birch forests. The allocation (aboveground and belowground) of NPP, but not the total NPP, differed significantly among the forest types. Litterfall (44%-60%) and fine root production (43%-47%) contributed the largest proportion of the aboveground and belowground NPP, respectively. The highest NEP was in the Korean pine plantation (328.0 g C.m(-2).year(-1)), followed by the old-growth (311.9 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) and secondary birch (231.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) forests, with the lowest NEP in the Dahurian larch plantation (187.9 g C.m(-2).year(-1)). These results suggest that the major forest types are currently C sinks and Korean pine plantation establishment can be a promising approach for increasing C sequestration in northeastern China.","[Cai, Huiying; Wang, Chuankuan; Shi, Baoku; Geng, Pengfei; Jin, Guangze] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Cai, Huiying; Chang, Scott X.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Di, Xueying] Northeast Forestry Univ, Sch Forestry, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Jin, GZ (reprint author), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",taxus@126.com,"Chang, Scott X/G-2029-2011; Jin, Guangze/F-5271-2017; Jin, Guangze/M-7312-2019","Jin, Guangze/0000-0002-9852-0965; Jin, Guangze/0000-0002-9852-0965; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426","Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2011BAD37B01]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [DL13EA05]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversitiesProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT_15R09]; NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) Discovery grant","This research was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (no. 2011BAD37B01), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (no.

However, our current knowledge regarding how endogenous or exogenous factors regulate the root dynamics of understory vegetation is limited. The aims of this study were to test the effects of soil moisture gradient and shading on the fine root production, phenology, and turnover rate of six shrub species from a subtropical forest. We selected a suite of study sites representing different habitats with gradients of soil moisture and solar radiation (shading or no shading). We assessed the fine root production phenology, the total fine root production, and the turnover among six understory shrub species in a subtropical climate, and examined the responses of the fine root dynamics to gradients in the soil moisture and solar radiation. The shrubs included three evergreen species, Loropetalum chinense, Vaccinium bracteatum, and Adinandra millettii, and three deciduous species, Serissa serissoides, Rubus corchorifolius, and Lespedeza davidii. Results We observed that variations in the annual fine root production and turnover among species were significant in the deciduous group but not in the evergreen group. Notably, V. bracteatum and S. serissoides presented the greatest responses in terms of root phenology to gradients in the soil moisture and shading: high-moisture habitat led to a decrease and shade led to an increase in fine root production during spring. Species with smaller fine roots of the 1(st)+2(nd)-order diameter presented more sensitive responses in terms of fine root phenology to a soil moisture gradient. Species with a lower fine root carbon- to nitrogen ratio exhibited more sensitive responses in terms of fine root annual production to shading. Soil moisture and shading did not change the annual fine root production as much as the turnover rate. The fine root dynamics of some understory shrubs varied significantly with soil moisture and solar radiation status and may be different from tree species. Our results emphasize the need to study the understory fine root dynamics in the achievement of a complete understanding of the overall belowground carbon cycling in a forest ecosystem, particularly ecosystems in which the understory fine root highly contributes to the belowground biomass.","[Fu, Xiaoli; Wang, Junlong; Wang, Huimin; Dai, Xiaoqin; Yang, Fengting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Qianyanzhou Ecol Stn, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Mei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China","Wang, HM (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Qianyanzhou Ecol Stn, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wanghm@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,National Key Basic Research Special Foundation ProjectNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB416903]; NSFC Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges [31210103920]; National Natural Science Foundations of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [41101203]; GanPo Distinguished Researcher Program,"We thank Dali Guo and Bitao Liu for their valuable comments regarding earlier versions of the manuscript.

Banding patterns from PCR-DGGE analyses of 28 plant species were evaluated by ordination scores relative to their rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structures. Plant family was the most important source of variation in sugar exudation rates and microbial community structure between plant species. Brassicaceae, which lacks a root symbiotic association, had the lowest sugar exudation rate, the lowest rhizosphere microbial mass, and a distinct fungal community structure relative to the other plant families. Fabaceae had a different bacterial community structure relative to the other plant families. These results demonstrate that root symbiotic associations have great impacts on the rate of sugar exudation and free-living microbial communities that inhabit the rhizosphere.","[Okubo, Atushi; Matsusaka, Motomu; Sugiyama, Shuichi] Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Aomori 0368156, Japan","Sugiyama, S (reprint author), Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Aomori 0368156, Japan.",sugi@hirosaki-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [13876072, 15380181]",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 13876072 and 15380181.,,40,9,11,1,63,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2016,399,2-Jan,,,,,345,356,,10.1007/s11104-015-2703-2,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,DC7UG,WOS:000369425300026,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dounavi, A; Netzer, F; Celepirovic, N; Ivankovic, M; Burger, J; Figueroa, AG; Schon, S; Simon, J; Cremer, E; Fussi, B; Konnert, M; Rennenberg, H",,,,"Dounavi, A.; Netzer, F.; Celepirovic, N.; Ivankovic, M.; Burger, J.; Figueroa, A.

Therefore the identification of beech ecotypes that cope with growth conditions expected in future is highly desirable for forest practitioners. In a pot experiment under controlled conditions, the influence of longterm water deprivation on growth, root/shoot ratio, nitrogen (N)- and carbon (C) assimilation of seedlings from 6 European beech (Fagus sylvatica) provenances, originating from Central Europe (Germany), the Balkan Peninsula (Croatia), and south-east Europe (Bulgaria, Greece) were examined. Genetic diversity and relationships between the provenances were analysed by molecular markers such as nuclear EST microsatellites (EST-SSRs), SNPs and chloroplast microsatellites. Genetic diversity within provenances was high and highlighted close relationships between plants from Greece, Croatia and Germany, whereas beech from Bavaria (Germany) seemed to be admixed with genotypes from Bulgaria. Significant changes in fine root delta C-13 and C/N ratio as well as the intrinsic Water Use Efficiency (iWUE) demonstrate a better adaptability to future environmental conditions of beech ecotypes genetically related to the Greek beech population.

Five sites were subjected to periodic flooding for 3months in 1997 and 1month in 2010. Fungal colonization was detected in 94% of 1296 root fragments examined. Fungi representing 126 taxa from Zygomycota (four species), Ascomycota (117 species) and Basidiomycota (five species) were isolated using culture-based methods and identified by morphotyping and sequencing of the ITS 1 and 2 rDNA. The most frequent eudominants (with colonization frequencies 10%) were Aspergillus spp., Cosmospora sp., Ilyonectria radicicola, Pezicula radicicola, Pyrenochaeta cava and six species of Trichoderma. Species composition did not vary greatly between sites, but only 3% of species occurred in all sites. Number of species was higher in roots subjected to floods. Eudominants and dominants present only on flooded sites included Aspergillus spp., Chaetomium globosum, Cosmospora sp., I.radicicola, Sporothrix inflata, Trichoderma harzianum, T.pubescens and T.virens. Structural roots were usually colonized by a higher number of species than fine roots. The majority of species detected belong to Class 2 NC-endophytes.

How these foliar endophytes respond to wildfires has not been studied previously, but is important given the increasing frequency and intensity of severe wildfires in many ecosystems, and because endophytes can influence plant growth and responses to stress. The goal of this study was to examine effects of severe wildfires on endophyte communities in forest trees, with a focus on traditionally fire-dominated, montane ecosystems in the southwestern USA. We evaluated the abundance, diversity, and composition of endophytes in foliage of Juniperus deppeana (Cupressaceae) and Quercus spp. (Fagaceae) collected contemporaneously from areas affected by recent wildfire and paired areas not affected by recent fire. Study sites spanned four mountain ranges in central and southern Arizona. Our results revealed significant effects of fires on endophyte communities, including decreases in isolation frequency, increases in diversity, and shifts in community structure and taxonomic composition among endophytes of trees affected by recent fires. Responses to fire were similar in endophytes of each host in these fire-dominated ecosystems and reflect regional fire-return intervals, with endophytes after fire representing subsets of the regional mycoflora. Together, these findings contribute to an emerging perspective on the responses of diverse communities to severe fire, and highlight the importance of considering fire history when estimating endophyte diversity and community structure for focal biomes.","[Huang, Yu-Ling; U'Ren, Jana M.; Furr, Susan H.; Arnold, A.

In this study, the rhizosphere bacterial community structure and diversity were compared between Phragmites australis monospecific community and A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities, aiming to assess whether A. trabeculosa influenced the rhizosphere bacterial communities of P. australis and to investigate whether different taxonomic groups within a soil community may respond similarly to the presence of an introduced exotic plant. Among the 14 phylogenetic phyla detected, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the dominant bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere. Phylogenetic analysis of the predominant Proteobacteria showed that the clones from the rhizosphere soils of A. trabeculosa and P. australis in A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities were more diverse than those in the rhizosphere soil of P. australis in P. australis monospecific community. The rhizosphere community in the wetland potentially included active microbial community related to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in the Yangtze River estuary. The rhizosphere soil of P. australis in A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities exhibited the highest Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson diversity index (1/D) (H = 4.52, 1/D = 253).

However, it remains unclear if grazing exclusion can improve ecosystem services related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration in grassland ecosystems. We investigated the effects of 11 years of grazing exclusion on plant biomass and diversity, soil properties (pH, soil water content (SWC), bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN),.and C/N ratio), and the C and N stocks of plants and soils in a desert grassland of Northwest China. Grazing exclusion improved plant aboveground biomass and diversity, as well as SWC, SOC, and TN contents, but lowered the belowground biomass, root/shoot ratio, pH, and BD. Moreover, grazing exclusion strongly influenced the C and N stocks of the ecosystem, and the annual mearbecosystem C and N sequestration rates were 0.47 and 0.09 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, over 11 years of grazing exclusion. Soil C stocks were most dynamic in the top 30 cm of the soil, and N stocks mainly changed in the top 20 cm after grazing exclusion.

We show, using a long-term factorial experiment, that plant diversity loss alters the effects of warming on productivity. Aboveground primary productivity was increased by both high plant diversity and warming, and, in concert, warming (approximate to 1.5 degrees C average above and belowground warming over the growing season) and diversity caused a greater than additive increase in aboveground productivity. The aboveground warming effects increased over time, particularly at higher levels of diversity, perhaps because of warming-induced increases in legume and C4 bunch grass abundances, and facilitative feedbacks of these species on productivity. Moreover, higher plant diversity was associated with the amelioration of warming-induced environmental conditions. This led to cooler temperatures, decreased vapor pressure deficit, and increased surface soil moisture in higher diversity communities. Root biomass (0-30cm) was likewise consistently greater at higher plant diversity and was greater with warming in monocultures and at intermediate diversity, but at high diversity warming had no detectable effect. This may be because warming increased the abundance of legumes, which have lower root:shoot ratios than the other types of plants. In addition, legumes increase soil nitrogen (N) supply, which could make N less limiting to other species and potentially decrease their investment in roots. The negative warmingxdiversity interaction on root mass led to an overall negative interactive effect of these two global change factors on the sum of above and belowground biomass, and thus likely on total plant carbon stores. In total, plant diversity increased the effect of warming on aboveground net productivity and moderated the effect on root mass. These divergent effects suggest that warming and changes in plant diversity are likely to have both interactive and divergent impacts on various aspects of ecosystem functioning.","[Cowles, Jane M.; Wragg, Peter D.; Powers, Jennifer S.; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Wright, Alexandra J.] FIT, Dept Sci & Math, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Powers, Jennifer S.] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Cowles, JM (reprint author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",janemcowles@gmail.com,,"Wright, Alexandra/0000-0002-5205-8576","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-062065, DEB-1234162]; Minnesota Environment; Natural Resources Trust Fund [048-B1]","We thank Troy Mielke and Cedar Creek interns for data collection.

In these forests, deadwood is particularly important for saproxylic and mycorrhizal fungi, sustaining forest productivity and environmental services. In this study, the saproxylic fungal diversity in Mediterranean mountain forests, characterized by different management histories and forest types (holm oak and beech), was analyzed. The relationships between saproxylic fungal biodiversity and structural attributes were considered in three forest stands of the Apennines (Italy). In addition, descriptive environmental parameters and forest traits were related to prevailing fungal communities, in order to analyze the species composition and distribution patterns of saproxylic fungi resulting from the ordination processes. The study sites were selected on the basis of their late-serial stage of development. Species frequency was analyzed through multivariate techniques to test the relationships between fungi, structural attributes and environmental variables. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to investigate the response of the overall fungal community structure to environmental gradients. Living tree volume, altitude, vegetation type, and the frequency of species with ephemeral sporocarp lifespan played a crucial role in diversifying species distribution patterns. Deadwood volume and decay classes were related to taxonomic and trophic community diversity. However, differences between the considered climatic regions exerted a major role on the occurrence of fungi with ephemeral sporocarps more than deadwood abundance, utilized primarily as fructification substrate.","[Persiani, Anna Maria; Lunghini, Dario; Granito, Vito Mario; Maggi, Oriana; Pioli, Silvia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Lombardi, Fabio] Mediterranean Univ Reggio Calabria, Dept Agron, I-89060 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Tognetti, Roberto; Marchetti, Marco] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, Italy; [Tognetti, Roberto] EFI Project Ctr Mt Forests MOUNTFOR, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy","Persiani, AM (reprint author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",annamaria.persiani@uniroma1.it,"MAGGI, ORIANA/C-9838-2010; Tognetti, Roberto/C-4962-2008","MAGGI, ORIANA/0000-0002-5523-3384; Tognetti, Roberto/0000-0002-7771-6176",,,,100,16,16,0,11,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,,,IFOREST,iForest,FEB,2016,9,,,,,,115,124,,10.3832/ifor1304-008,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,DG5OK,WOS:000372127500001,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19J,"Shao, YH; Wang, XL; Zhao, J; Wu, JP; Zhang, WX; Neher, DA; Li, YX; Lou, YP; Fu, SL",,,,"Shao, Yuanhu; Wang, Xiaoli; Zhao, Jie; Wu, Jianping; Zhang, Weixin; Neher, Deborah A.; Li, Yanxia; Lou, Yiping; Fu, Shenglei",,,Subordinate plants sustain the complexity and stability of soil micro-food webs in natural bamboo forest ecosystems,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,complexity; plant removal; soil micro-food web; soil nematodes; stability; subordinate plants; subtropical forest,FATTY-ACID PROFILES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; FEEDBACK; BIOMASS; RESISTANCE; ECOLOGY; RESILIENCE,"Subordinate plants have a significant impact on soil organisms in primary successional floodplains and grassland ecosystems, but their role in subtropical forest ecosystems remains unclear. An experiment was conducted in a subtropical forest to test the hypothesis that removal of shrubs or subordinate arbour tree species would reduce the complexity and stability of the soil micro-food web. Principal response curves (PRCs) were performed to assess the responses of soil microbial and nematode communities to plant removal compared with a control through time. The effect of plant removal on complexity and stability in the soilmicro-food web was assessed using a suite of indices including ratio of omnivorous-predatory to herbivorous nematode abundance (OP:H ratio), nematode diversity, resistance and resilience. Furthermore, increments of bamboo productivity among treatments were estimated. Soil microbial community structure changed in response to plant removal in 2009, but recovered in 2010, and the only change observed was increased soil fungal biomass. In contrast, plant removal had greater impact on soil nematode community composition in 2010 than 2009. Subordinate arbour tree species removal (with or without shrubs) decreased the values of nematode richness, evenness, diversity, ratio of microbial-feeding to herbivorous nematode abundance (M:H ratios), OP:H ratios and resistance indices in 2010, but only decreased OP:H ratios in 2009 and increased the values of nematode dominance in 2010. Although increments in bamboo productivity were statistically similar among treatments, there was a trend decreasing progressively from control to shrub removal + selective-cutting of subordinate arbour tree species, shrub removal, and selective-cutting of subordinate arbour tree species treatments.Synthesis and applications. Subordinate plants help sustain the complexity and stability of soil micro-food webs in subtropical bamboo forest ecosystems. Therefore, protection of subordinate plants and maintaining high plant diversity are important parts of a responsible management strategy in subtropical bamboo forests.","[Shao, Yuanhu; Wang, Xiaoli; Zhang, Weixin; Fu, Shenglei] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoli] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianping] Nanchang Inst Technol, Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Peoples R China; [Neher, Deborah A.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Li, Yanxia; Lou, Yiping] Int Network Bamboo & Rattan, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanxia; Lou, Yiping] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Subtrop Forestry, Fuyang 311400, Peoples R China","Fu, SL (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sfu@scbg.ac.cn,"Zhang, Weixin/D-3540-2017; Neher, Deborah/H-2716-2019","Zhang, Weixin/0000-0001-9656-9522; Neher, Deborah/0000-0002-9647-8783","Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [31210103920, 31470559, 31100385]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-Z-6]; 'International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR)","We are grateful to Messrs Yongbiao Lin for his technical help.

The study was conducted in an even-aged C. microphylla plantation in a semiarid area in the Mu Us Desert of China. Rates of R (fr) and net photosynthesis were measured using a standard chamber equipped with a portable gas analysis system. The data revealed two diel patterns that varied with different phenological stages. Diurnal R (fr) rates were 2.2-fold greater than nocturnal R (fr) rates. Our results showed that diurnal changes in R (fr) strongly correlated with rates of net photosynthesis, suggesting that the diel changes were strongly associated with the current supply of photosynthates. Furthermore, aboveground phenology could partially explain some of the variations in seasonal R (fr). Our results provide basic information on the link between R (fr) and aboveground activities, and enhance our understanding of carbon processes in dryland ecosystems.","[Lai, Zongrui; Lu, Su; Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin; Qin, Shugao; Feng, Wei; Fa, Keyu] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Lai, Zongrui; Zhang, Yuqing; Wu, Bin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiabin] Northwest A&F Univ, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, YQ (reprint author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Yanchi Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhangyqbjfu@gmail.com; wubin@bjfu.edu.cn,,,National Science and Technology Support Program of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan [2012BAD16B02]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BJFU-TD2011-04],"This research was supported by the National Science and Technology Support Program of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (No. 2012BAD16B02) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (BJFU-TD2011-04).

Our objective was to determine how physical, chemical and microbiological soil attributes influence AMF species distribution, total-GRSP (T-GRSP) and easily extractable-GRSP (EE-GRSP). Glomus and Acaulospora were related to impacted sites, Gigasporarosea to sites R10 and R20 that have different management histories and soil textures and Glomus geosporum to sites NT and R10, suggesting some influence of texture on its distribution. Scutellospora pellucida and other species were found only in one season. Correlations between EE-GRSP and T-GRSP on the one hand and total carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase and urease activity, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen, on the other, reached values of 40-70% and were especially strong in summer. Soil bulk density had a negative and macroporosity a positive effect only on EE-GRSP, suggesting the necessity to choose either EE-GRSP or T-GRSP as biological indicator depending on the soil characteristics and management. This study demonstrates the effect of recovery age, seasonality and other soil attributes on AMF and GRSP distribution and shows that these biological attributes may be used as indicators of soil quality in the Atlantic forest in Brazil.

A field experiment was conducted in a continuously cultivated farm station in Xinjiang province, northwest China, including a saline-desert land. The objective was to investigate the effects of different cotton cultivation periods from 1 to 16 years on soil chemical and soil biological properties. Cultivation led to a decrease in soil electrical conductivity and reduced soil pH from 8.9 in uncultivated land to 7.9. Soil organic C showed a small and variable increase after cultivation. After year 1 of cultivation, the contents of muramic acid, galactosamine and glucosamine were all roughly 30% lower, similarly to those of PLEA in comparison with the uncultivated soil. Further cultivation led to a continuous non-linear 40% increase until year 16 in comparison with the uncultivated soil, which mainly occurred within five years of cultivation. The ratio of fungal C to bacterial C, based on fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid, varied around 0.7 in the uncultivated soil and around 1.4 from the second year on after cultivation. Microbial biomass C showed a 100% increase to contents around 300 mu g g(-1) soil from year 4 to 16 in comparison with the initial values. The microbial biomass C to SOC ratio ranged from 2 to 6% without clear cultivation effects. The ergosterol to microbial biomass C ratio increased from values around 0.04% during the first 3 years to values around 0.2% from year 4 on. Also, the Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacterial PLEA ratio increased with increasing cultivation time, whereas the microbial biomass C to total PLEA ratio varied in a relatively small range around 8.9 mu g nmol(-1).

The ELCA provides a comprehensive framework to assess the primary resources requirements of products by means of the conversion of primary flows of energy and raw materials absorbed by a production process into exergy. The soil erosion technologies described in the work are analysed according to two complementary indicators: the annual average soil loss and the life cycle primary exergy requirements. The primary exergy requirement of the different applications is measured by means of three ELCA indicators: the Cumulative Exergy Demand (CExD), the Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC) and the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from Natural Environment (CEENE). The specific context of the application is a highway slope of the size of I hectare situated along the A1 highway, near the town of Fabro (TR), in Italy. The results indicate that DRPs are the most suitable solutions. However, TEC, CExD and CEENE indexes of these technologies suggest the existence of hidden impacts related to land use. The same result characterises also Bio-mats, the technology with the highest contribution of renewable material along the life cycle phases. In conclusion, this work shows that the use of exergy based impact indexes for the environmental impact assessment supplies a wider framework and deeper insights of the environmental performance of production processes and products.

NIGRA; NEW-ZEALAND; HYBRID POPLAR; POPULUS-DELTOIDES; CLONES; FINE; CUTTINGS; TREES; PLANTATIONS,"Background: Poplar trees (Populus spp.) are used widely for soil conservation. A key advantage is their ability to establish from unrooted stem sections of varying dimensions, ranging from small cuttings to large poles. This study determined root length and biomass of young trees from three different-sized stem sections and quantified clonal variation. Methods: Two concurrent field trials were conducted: trial 1 compared root attributes of trees from cuttings, stakes, and poles of a single poplar clone, while trial 2 compared those of trees from cuttings of six poplar clones. Excavations of entire trees were conducted in autumn for three (trial 1) or two (trial 2) years after planting. Results: Total root mass averaged over 3 years was in the order poles (364 g) > stakes (70 g) > cuttings (17 g), and total root length was in the order poles (73 m) > stakes (21 m) > cuttings (7 m). Maximum lateral root extension was approximately 2.6 m from poles, 1.7 m from stakes, and 0.8 m from cuttings. Clonal variation in trees from cuttings was found for both mean total root mass (10.4-45.9 g) and total root length (3.5-11.8 m). In both trials, root mass and length increased, decreased, or were unchanged with increasing 0.5-m increments of the distance from stem and soil depth, depending on year, planting material, root diameter, and their interaction. Conclusions: Early root development from poles was greater than from cuttings, with development from stakes being intermediate. Different poplar clones exhibited large variation in root biomass development within 2 years of planting. The results provide an understanding of the differences in early root development of poplar planting materials and clones used for soil conservation and other purposes and guidance on appropriate tree spacings of different planting materials to achieve root interlock.","[Douglas, Grant B.; Lloyd-West, Catherine M.] AgResearch, Private Bag 11008, Palmerston North, New Zealand; [McIvor, Ian R.] Plant & Food Res, Private Bag 11600, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Douglas, GB (reprint author), AgResearch, Private Bag 11008, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",grant.douglas@agresearch.co.nz,"McKenzie, Catherine/O-6723-2018","McKenzie, Catherine/0000-0002-3075-954X","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology's 'Sustainable Land Use Research Initiative' (SLURI) programme [C02X0813]","Funding from New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology's 'Sustainable Land Use Research Initiative' (SLURI) programme (Contract No. C02X0813, Objective 2); large teams of post-graduate students from Massey University, Palmerston North, for assisting with tree excavations and sample processing; Drs.

An alternative is to investigate natural systems that have long-term and stable environmental conditions that are opposed to those of the surrounding ecosystem. Locally extreme environments provide an example of this, and are a powerful tool for the study of slower ecological and evolutionary processes, allowing the investigation of longer term mechanisms at logistically tractable spatial and temporal scales. These systems can be used to gain insight into adaptation of natural communities and their ecological networks. We present a case study and review the literature investigating biological communities at terrestrial mofettes-natural sites with constant geogenic CO2 exhalations and consequent soil hypoxia. Mofettes are often used as natural analogues to future conditions predicted by current climate change scenarios, as model ecosystems for environmental impact assessments of carbon capture and storage systems and for the investigation of physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies of a range of phylogenetically distinct organisms across spatial scales. The scientific power of locally extreme environments is just starting to be harnessed and these systems are bound to provide growing insight into long-term ecological processes, which will be essential for our capacity to adequately manage ecosystems and predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change.","[Macek, I.; Vodnik, D.] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Macek, I.] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol FAMNIT, Koper, Slovenia; [Pfanz, H.] Univ Duisburg Essen, Lehrstuhl Angew Bot, Essen, Germany; [Low-Decarie, E.; Dumbrell, A.

Thirtyone soil samples were collected from 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-40 cm depths, and each sampling point was georeferenced. The pH (in H2O), potential acidity (H+Al), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), aluminum (Al+3), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), phosphorus (P), organic carbon (C), cation exchange capacity of the soil (T value), base saturation (V value), total clay, total sand, silt, and density of fine roots were measured. The software ArcGIS 10.2 was used to perform the semivariogram analysis and the fitting of the models, and spatial interpolation was performed using a first-order trend ordinary kriging process with spherical, exponential, and Gaussian spatial models. Based on the results, only the exponential and Gaussian models were fitted to the variables, except for the Mg2+ and V value variables, which presented no spatial dependence, thus showing a pure nugget effect (PNE). Distribution maps were generated for the variables (except for those exhibiting PNE), which showed correlation between the variables pH and Al3+, organic carbon and cations, phosphorus and total clay, and silt and sand. Overall, geostatistics could be applied to spatialize the chemical and physical attributes of the soil in the agroforestry system, except in the case of Mg2+ and the V value.","[da Silva, Camila Santos; Pereira, Marcos Gervasio; Delgado, Rafael Coll; da Silva, Eduardo Vinicius] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Seropedica, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Pereira, MG (reprint author), Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Seropedica, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mgervasiopereira01@gmail.com,"Coll Delgado, Rafael/D-2879-2013; Pereira, Marcos/F-1585-2018","Coll Delgado, Rafael/0000-0002-3157-2277; Pereira, Marcos/0000-0002-1402-3612",,,,31,1,1,0,8,UNIV FEDERAL LAVRAS-UFLA,LAVRAS,"CAIXA POSTAL 3037, LAVRAS, MG 37200-000, BRAZIL",0104-7760,,,CERNE,Cerne,,2016,22,4,,,,,407,414,,10.1590/01047760201622042159,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,EL3SY,WOS:000394540800006,,DOAJ Gold,,,10/31/19B,"Bao, S; Mustapha, A; Lou, HJ",,,ASME,"Bao, Sheng; Mustapha, Ashri; Lou, Huangjie",,,CORRELATION BETWEEN STRESS CONCENTRATION DEGREE AND RESIDUAL MAGNETIC FIELD,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 35TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING , 2016, VOL 4",,,English,Proceedings Paper,"35th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering","JUN 19-24, 2016","Busan, SOUTH KOREA","ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div",,,SIGNALS; STEEL,"In this research, the correlation between the stress concentration degree and the residual magnetic field (RMF) of ferromagnetic steels is investigated.

The effectivity of the metal magnetic memory (MMM) technique in defective specimens was investigated in comparison with a non-defective specimen. Analysis of the qualitative relationship between the stress concentration degree and the RMF components was subsequently performed on two types of defective specimens. The qualitative correlation between the planar distributions of the RMF components and the stress concentration degree was further studied. It was validated that both the RMF signal and its planar distribution are effective in characterizing the stress concentration degree. The results obtained in this research will be a complement to the MMM technique.","[Bao, Sheng; Lou, Huangjie] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Struct Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mustapha, Ashri] Petronas, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Bao, S (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Struct Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LZ12E08003]; Public Welfare Technology Research Projects of Zhejiang Province [2013C31013]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015QNA4028]; Interdisciplinary Research Fund for Young Scholars in Zhejiang University [JCZZ-2013018]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [50901067],"This work was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LZ12E08003), Public Welfare Technology Research Projects of Zhejiang Province (2013C31013), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015QNA4028), Interdisciplinary Research Fund for Young Scholars in Zhejiang University (JCZZ-2013018) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (50901067).",,9,0,0,0,2,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",,,978-0-7918-4995-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,UNSP V004T03A028,,,,6,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,BG9DO,WOS:000393090700028,,,,,10/31/19J,"Klock, MM; Barrett, LG; Thrall, PH; Harms, KE",,,,"Klock, Metha M.; Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.; Harms, Kyle E.",,,Differential plant invasiveness is not always driven by host promiscuity with bacterial symbionts,AOB PLANTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acacia; biological invasions; interactions; invasive; legume; mutualisms; rhizobia,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ACACIA-CYCLOPS; RHIZOBIA; ASSOCIATIONS; MUTUALISMS; EVOLUTION; LEGUMES; TREES; COMMUNITIES; DISPERSAL,"Identification of mechanisms that allow some species to outcompete others is a fundamental goal in ecology and invasive species management. One useful approach is to examine congeners varying in invasiveness in a comparative framework across native and invaded ranges. Acacia species have been widely introduced outside their native range of Australia, and a subset of these species have become invasive in multiple parts of the world. Within specific regions, the invasive status of these species varies. Our study examined whether a key mechanism in the life history of Acacia species, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, influences acacia invasiveness on a regional scale. To assess the extent to which species varying in invasiveness correspondingly differ with regard to the diversity of rhizobia they associate with, we grew seven Acacia species ranging in invasiveness in California in multiple soils from both their native (Australia) and introduced (California) ranges. In particular, the aim was to determine whether more invasive species formed symbioses with a wider diversity of rhizobial strains (i.e. are more promiscuous hosts). We measured and compared plant performance, including aboveground biomass, survival, and nodulation response, as well as rhizobial community composition and richness. Host promiscuity did not differ among invasiveness categories. Acacia species that varied in invasiveness differed in aboveground biomass for only one soil and did not differ in survival or nodulation within individual soils. In addition, acacias did not differ in rhizobial richness among invasiveness categories. However, nodulation differed between regions and was generally higher in the native than introduced range. Our results suggest that all Acacia species introduced to California are promiscuous hosts and that host promiscuity per se does not explain the observed differences in invasiveness within this region. Our study also highlights the utility of assessing potential mechanisms of invasion in species' native and introduced ranges.","[Klock, Metha M.; Harms, Kyle E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Barrett, Luke G.; Thrall, Peter H.] CSIRO Agr Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Klock, MM (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",klockmm@gmail.com,,,Louisiana Board of Regents EPSCoR grant; National Science Foundation (United States)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1311290]; Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research (United States); Louisiana Environmental Education Commission Research grant,"Our work was funded by a Louisiana Board of Regents EPSCoR grant, funding from the National Science Foundation (DEB-1311290) (United States), a Sigma Xi Grant-in-Aid of Research (United States) and a Louisiana Environmental Education Commission Research grant.",,62,5,5,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2016,8,,,,SI,,,,plw060,10.1093/aobpla/plw060,,,17,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EJ1KV,WOS:000392970000001,27535176,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Le Roux, JJ; Mavengere, NR; Ellis, AG",,,,"Le Roux, Johannes J.; Mavengere, Natasha R.; Ellis, Allan G.",,,The structure of legume-rhizobium interaction networks and their response to tree invasions,AOB PLANTS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biological invasions; co-introduction; cosmopolitan rhizobia; legume-rhizobium interaction webs; network specialization,EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS; BETA-RHIZOBIA; MIMOSA-PIGRA; NEW-ZEALAND; PLANT; SOUTH; BURKHOLDERIA; SEQUENCE; NODULATION; DIVERSITY,"Establishing mutualistic interactions in novel environments is important for the successful establishment of some non-native plant species. These associations may, in turn, impact native species interaction networks as non-natives become dominant in their new environments. Using phylogenetic and ecological interaction network approaches we provide the first report of the structure of belowground legume-rhizobium interaction networks and how they change along a gradient of invasion (uninvaded, semi invaded and heavily invaded sites) by Australian Acacia species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We found that native and invasive legumes interact with distinct rhizobial lineages, most likely due to phylogenetic uniqueness of native and invasive host plants. Moreover, legume-rhizobium interaction networks are not nested, but significantly modular with high levels of specialization possibly as a result of legume-rhizobium co-evolution. Although network topology remained constant across the invasion gradient, composition of bacterial communities associated with native legumes changed dramatically as acacias increasingly dominated the landscape. In stark contrast to aboveground interaction networks (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal) we show that invasive legumes do not infiltrate existing native legume-rhizobium networks but rather form novel modules. This absence of mutualist overlap between native and invasive legumes suggests the importance of co-invading rhizobium-acacia species complexes for Acacia invasion success, and argues against a ubiquitous role for the formation and evolutionary refinement of novel interactions.","[Le Roux, Johannes J.; Mavengere, Natasha R.; Ellis, Allan G.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Le Roux, JJ (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",jacoleroux01@gmail.com,"; Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Le Roux, Johannes/0000-0001-7911-9810; Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; MAVENGERE, NATASHA/0000-0003-0863-9717","DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology (C.

Salinity and herbivory, separately, can severely hinder plant growth and reproduction, but the combined effects of both factors are still not clearly understood. Salinity is known to reduce plant tissue nitrogen content and growth rates. Since herbivores prefer tissues with high N content, and biochemical pathways leading to resistance are commonly elicited by salt-stress, we hypothesized that plants growing in saline conditions would have enhanced resistance against herbivores. The non-halophyte, Brassica juncea, and the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni were used to test the prediction that plants subjected to salinity stress would be both more resistant and more tolerant to herbivory than those growing without salt stress. Plants were grown under different NaCl levels, and either exposed to herbivores and followed by removal of half of their leaves, or left intact. Plants were left to grow and reproduce until senescence. Tissue quality was assessed, seeds were counted and biomass of different organs measured. Plants exposed to salinity grew less, had reduced tissue nitrogen, protein and chlorophyll content, although proline levels increased. Specific leaf area, leaf water content, transpiration and root: shoot ratio remained unaffected. Plants growing under saline condition had greater constitutive resistance than unstressed plants. However, induced resistance and tolerance were not affected by salinity. These results support the hypothesis that plants growing under salt-stress are better defended against herbivores, although in B. juncea this may be mostly through resistance, and less through tolerance.","[Renault, Sylvie; Markham, John] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Wolfe, Scott; Avila-Sakar, German] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Biol, 599 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2G3, Canada","Renault, S (reprint author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",Sylvie.Renault@umanitoba.ca,"Sakar, German Avila/G-4243-2011","Sakar, German Avila/0000-0003-2752-7163","University of Manitoba (University Research Grant Program, Winnipeg, Canada); University of Winnipeg through a Major Research Grant (Winnipeg, Canada)","Funding for this project was provided by the University of Manitoba (University Research Grant Program, Winnipeg, Canada) to S.R. and by The University of Winnipeg through a Major Research Grant (Winnipeg, Canada) to G.A.S.",,66,3,3,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,,2016,8,,,,,,,,plw028,10.1093/aobpla/plw028,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EI1DE,WOS:000392215200001,27169610,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,10/31/19J,"Matsiakh, I; Oszako, T; Kramarets, V; Nowakowska, JA",,,,"Matsiakh, Iryna; Oszako, Tomasz; Kramarets, Volodymyr; Nowakowska, Justyna Anna",,,Phytophthora and Pythium Species Detected in Rivers of the Polish-Ukrainian Border Areas,BALTIC FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,water courses; Oomycetes; phytopathogens; seedlings; watering; nurseries,ALDER ALNUS-GLUTINOSA; PLANT-PATHOGENS; WATER; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASE; SPP.; NURSERIES; ROT; RESERVOIRS; DIVERSITY,"There are many records in the literature demonstrating that species belonging to the genus Phytophthora and Pythium cause damage to fine root and trunk collars of many forest tree species.
