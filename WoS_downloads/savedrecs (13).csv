GROWTH RATES; WOODY SEEDLINGS; ROOT; SHOOT RATIO; WEEDS; SUCCESSION; CANTERBURY,NEW-ZEALAND; GROWTH; SUCCESSION,"Seedlings of fifteen species of shrubs and small trees, commonly found in open sites and early stages of secondary succession, were grown in a glasshouse under light intensities of 16% and 66% full daylight, and their growth parameters (height, number of leaves, dry weight, mean relative growth rate) recorded. Three species from open habitats, Coprosma robusta and Dodonaea viscosa, and an adventive shrub, Crataegus monogyna, had the highest mean relative growth rates in 66% daylight and 16% daylight, but their ranking for other parameters (e.g. height) was variable. Acer pseudoplatanus and Plagianthus regius had particularly fast height growth. Carpodetus serratus was the fastest growing species of early successional vegetation on weakly to moderately leached soils, and it grew as well in 16% daylight as in 66% daylight. Many species has significantly faster height growth in 16% daylight, e.g., Melicytus ramiflorus and Pittosporum tenuifolium, and several species had faster height growth rates overall, in 16% daylight, e.g., Myrsine australis, Melicytus ramiflorus, and Pittosporum eugenioides. Griselinia littoralis, from moderately to strongly leached soils, had the slowest height growth rates in both light levels. All species had lower root:shoot ratios and a greater proportion of dry weight in leaves in 16% daylight. Such responses may contribute to the slow establishment of these species in secondary vegetation experiencing summer drought in the seedlings' rooting zone. Growth patterns are also likely to be adaptations to factors other than light, particularly soil fertility. There is some evidence that seedlings of the earliest successional and less shade-tolerant species, especially those from weakly leached soils, grew more rapidly than those from later-successional vegetation and edaphically harsher sites. Some shade-tolerant species benefit from slight shade which concurs with their later entry into secondary vegetation.","DSIR,DIV BOT,NELSON,NEW ZEALAND; DSIR,DIV BOT,CHRISTCHURCH,NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,26,17,17,0,7,NEW ZEALAND ECOL SOC,CHRISTCHURCH,"PO BOX 25178, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND",0110-6465,,,NEW ZEAL J ECOL,N.

It is recommended that differences in wood production be analysed, not by statistical methods, traditional growth analysis or by comprehensive models, but by using a 'light use analysis', where wood production is determined by (1) the amount of light intercepted by the canopy, (2) the light use efficiency, net of respiration, (3) the proportion of assimilates partitioned to wood, and (4) mortality losses. These four components are discussed.","Inst Terr Ecol, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland","Cannell, MGR (reprint author), Inst Terr Ecol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,Commission of European CommunitiesEuropean Union (EU),"This review is largely taken from Chapter 2 of the book ""Biomass Forestry in Europe: a Strategy for the Future"", ed.

Mycorrhization of P. abies and Larix decidua was compared, and the process was found to be significantly different in the two tree species. S. grevillei is not incompatible with P. abies, but it forms mycorrhizae more readily with L. decidua. Hyphal growth was clearly stimulated on the surface of roots of Larix but retarded on Picea. A well organized Hartig net was formed with both tree species, but wall protuberances were frequently observed on the outer cell walls of Picea cortex cells when the Hartig net was not fully developed. No conspicuous cell wall reactions occurred in Larix roots. Cell wall protuberances may be comparable to those in transfer cells and are interpreted as an alternative to Hartig net development. Anatomical differences between roots of Larix and Picea, and physiologically active substances such as recognition factors on the root surfaces, are discussed with respect to their responsibility for the different reactions of S. grevillei.","[Kottke, Ingrid; Oberwinkler, Franz] Univ Tubingen, Inst Biol 1, Spezielle Bot & Bot Garten, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany","Kottke, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Biol 1, Spezielle Bot & Bot Garten, Morgenstelle 1, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),The authors are indebted to Dr. M.

Plasticity was measured by relating phenotypic variations to the state of the plant growing at a maximum relative growth rate (R). The degree of plasticity of a phenotypic feature was independent of its level of organization but was species-dependent. Mean root radius was always the least plastic feature. Different degrees of plasticity occurred in different features of the same plants. There was little difference between species in overall plasticity. R was attained by each species adopting a unique phenotype which always included optimal values for root/shoot ratio and of total nitrogen concentrations in roots and shoots, other features being optimized, minimized or maximized depending on species. Root/shoot ratio was stabilized close to the optimum in D. flexuosa but varied widely in other species. At low concentrations of either nitrate or ammonium, the nitrogen concentrations in shoots of D. flexuosa and L. perenne cv. 'Norlea' were maintained optimally for growth but those in the roots were reduced.","[Robinson, D.; Rorison, I.

The experimental plots, with an area of 113 m(2) each, were separated from the surrounding trees by trenching and emplacement of an aluminium sheet to a depth of 50 cm. The standard nitrogen application rate was 150 kg N ha(-1) and the nitrogen sources tested were calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and urea. Two growing seasons after the application of fertilizer, all the experimental plots were subjected to destructive sampling, including soil, field vegetation and trees, with a view to producing a nitrogen balance sheet for the experimental treatments involved. The fertilizer nitrogen recovered in the part of the ecosystem under study varied between 76 and 92% of the fertilizer N applied (150 kg N ha(-1)). The highest recovery figure applies to treatment with a split dose of ammonium nitrate and the lowest to calcium nitrate. For a low dose of ammonium nitrate (=50 kg N ha(-1)), the recovery figure was close to 100%. It was found rather characteristic that the nitrogen source indicating the highest accumulation figure for labelled N in the stand, i.e., calcium nitrate (44%), showed the lowest percentage recovery figure in the soil (28%). The urea source of nitrogen, on the other hand, showed a relatively low nitrogen accumulation figure in the stand (20%), but an extremely high figure for immobilization in the soil (62%). For ammonium nitrate, which is the dominating nitrogen material used for forest fertilization in Sweden, the distribution of recovered labelled N after two growing seasons was, on the average: trees, 33%; field layer vegetation, 1%; fine roots, 6%; and immobilized in soil, 48%. The split application of nitrogen decreased the labelled N recovery in the trees and increased the recovery in soil. Concentrated placement of ammonium nitrate and urea (1 nest m(-2)), compared with that of broadcast nitrogen materials, did not measurably affect the amounts of fertilizer N taken up by the trees. The accumulation of fertilizer nitrogen in the trees was closely related to the basal area of the stem. It was also found that the fertilizer-N uptake was higher for Norway spruce than for Scots pine of the same basal area. A certain measure of caution must be exercised in interpreting data on labelled-N distribution in the ecosystem, particularly in view of the ongoing biological isotope exchange process in the soil media. An interference of this kind affects mainly the ammonium form of nitrogen. It results in an underestimation of the uptake of ammonium and urea form of fertilizer nitrogen by the trees, and in an overestimation of the processes leading to immobilization of ammonium N in the soil organic pool. By following the changes in the size and the isotope composition of the exchangeable ammonium pool during the first growing season, a rough value for the correction factor relating to the net nitrogen accumulation in the stand was estimated.","[Melin, Judith; Nommik, Hans] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Soils, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Melin, J (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Soils, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,"Swedish Council for Forestry and Agricultural ResearchSwedish Research Council Formas; Stiftelsen Svensk Vaxtnaringsforskning, Royal Academy of Agriculture and Forestry","This study was supported by funds from the Swedish Council for Forestry and Agricultural Research, and from the Stiftelsen Svensk Vaxtnaringsforskning, Royal Academy of Agriculture and Forestry.",,25,13,13,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,1651-1891,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

Features of hyphal mantle structure have been used for establishing an identification key. The colour of the hyphal mantle is a helpful additional characteristic, but is not useful as a diagnostic feature because of variations in advanced age and under varying environmental conditions. Rhizomorphs yield good taxonomic characteristics. The Hartig net was uniform for all types examined. When differences were observed they had to be interpreted as different stages of development. Ultrastructural examination revealed further features of mycorrhizal types: namely the shape of septal pores, presence and structure of matrix material in the region of the hyphal mantle and characteristic deposits on cell walls of the hyphae. The ten types presented can be distinguished without any ultrastructural features. As far as the fungal partners involved are concerned, basidiomycetes are clearly dominant. For the first time two basidiomycetes with continuous parenthesomes of their dolipores were found to form ectomycorrhizae. Classification of these fungi with the heterobasidiomycetes is discussed.","[Haug, Ingeborg; Oberwinkler, Franz] Univ Tubingen, Lehrstuhl Spezielle Bot, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany","Haug, I (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Lehrstuhl Spezielle Bot, Morgenstelle 1, D-7400 Tubingen, Germany.",,,,Bundesministerium fur Forschung und Technologie [Forderkennzeichen 373292]; Projekt Europaisches Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe,The authors are indebted to the Bundesministerium fur Forschung und Technologie (Forderkennzeichen 373292) and the Projekt Europaisches Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe for grants during the investigation.,,25,29,31,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

Kustaa, Hankkija-673 and Pokko were tested for their anoxia and. flooding tolerance to observe whether anoxia tolerance is related to flooding tolerance and whether the cultivars differ in their anoxia and flooding tolerance. Three-day-old seedlings were incubated under anoxia at +5 degrees C for 10-20 days. In addition a tetrazolium chloride test was carried out to identify the site of anoxic or post-anoxic damage. Flooding tolerance of the barley cultivars was investigated by growing plants to maturity (flowering and seed production) under permanently flooded conditions. The flooding tolerance of the cultivars correlated positively with anoxia tolerance, Kustaa being the most and Pokko the least tolerant and productive of the three tested cultivars. Thus at an intraspecific level anoxia tolerance can be related to flooding tolerance. The TTC-test showed that root tissue, and especially root tips, were more susceptible to anoxia than shoot tissue. The roots of the cultivar Kustaa showed longer tolerance of anoxia than the other two cultivars, with the proximal region of the roots surviving the anoxic treatment. In some cases surviving shoots of the variety Kustaa produced new roots at the base of the stem.","[Fagerstedt, K. V.; Crawford, R. M.

Karst.). Large increases in stemwood production during the first 12 years of the experiments were achieved by fertilization especially when a balanced mixture of macro- and micronutrients was applied. The effect of irrigation alone was small but it greatly enhanced the response of the ground vegetation to the application of a balanced fertilizer. Fertilization did not greatly affect the leaf/stemwood biomass ratio but reduced the ratio of fine roots to total biomass.

Fine root TNC content was highest during the dry summer (May), and lowest in the early part of the rainy season (July). Generally, seasonal trends in TNC content were the opposite of those in fine root biomass. The TNC concentration of roots increased with diameter and decreased with soil depth.
