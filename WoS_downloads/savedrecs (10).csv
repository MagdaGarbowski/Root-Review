Estimates of autotrophic respiration are difficult for forest ecosystems, because of the large amount of biomass, different metabolic rates among tissues, and seasonal variation in respiration rates. We examined spatial and seasonal patterns in autotrophic respiration in a Pinus strobus ecosystem, and hypothesized that seasonal patterns in respiration rates at a common temperature would vary with [N] for fully expanded foliage and fine roots, with photosynthesis for foliage, and with growth for woody tissues (stems, branches, and coarse roots). We also hypothesized that differences in [N] would largely explain differences in maintenance or dormant-season respiration among tissues. For April-November, mean respiration at 15degreesC varied from 1.5 to 2.8 mumol kg(-1) s(-1) for fully expanded foliage, 1.7-3.0 for growing foliage, 0.8-1.6 for fine roots, 0.6-1.1 (sapwood) for stems, 0.5-1.8 (sapwood) for branches, and 0.2-1.5 (sapwood) for coarse roots. Growing season variation in respiration for foliage produced the prior year was strongly related to [N] (r(2) = 0.94), but fine root respiration was not related to [N]. For current-year needles, respiration did not covary with [N]. Night-time foliar respiration did not vary in concert with previous-day photosynthesis for either growing or fully expanded needles. Stem growth explained about one-third of the seasonal variation in stem respiration (r(2) = 0.38), and also variation among trees (r(2) = 0.43). We did not determine the cause of seasonal variation in branch and coarse root respiration, but it is unlikely to be directly related to growth, as the pattern of respiration in coarse roots and branches was not synchronized with stem growth. Seasonal variations in temperature-corrected respiration rates were not synchronized among tissues, except foliage and branches. Spatial variability in dormant-season respiration rates was significantly related to tissue N content in foliage (r(2) = 0.67), stems (r(2) = 0.45), coarse roots (r(2) = 0.36), and all tissues combined (r(2) =0.83), but not for fine roots and branches. Per unit N, rates for P. strobus varied from 0.22 to 3.4 mumol molN(-1) s(-1) at 15degreesC, comparable to those found for other conifers. Accurate estimates of annual autotrophic respiration should reflect seasonal and spatial variation in respiration rates of individual tissues.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Coweeta Hydrol Lab, Otto, NC 28763 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Vose, JM (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Coweeta Hydrol Lab, 3160 Coweeta Lab RD, Otto, NC 28763 USA.",,"Ryan, Michael G/A-9805-2008","Ryan, Michael G/0000-0002-2500-6738",,,,59,104,135,0,66,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The application of benomyl resulted in a significant reduction of AM colonization on roots of S. patens, but did not completely suppress AM. Non-treated cores had significantly greater colonization (26+/-6%) than either benomyl-(12+/-7%) or benomyl-phosphorus-treated (7+/-3%) cores at a depth of 2.5 cm. Colonization differences between cores declined with depth (5.0 and 7.5 cm). however, so that at 7.5 cm there was no difference between treatments. This decline was attributed to a reduction in oxygen availability with depth as evidenced by decreasing redox potential. Basic environmental conditions generally resembled those found at the field site. There were no environmental differences between treatments at the depths examined. Cell numbers and specific biomass of DAPI-stained organisms as well as members of the Domain Bacteria were significantly higher when AM colonization was suppressed. while those of the Domains Eucarya and Archaea were not significantly influenced. The increase in both microbial and bacterial population size and biomass in the presence of lower levels of AM colonization is most likely due to increases in carbon exudation to soil and rhizosphere populations that accompany AM suppression. PCR-RFLP analysis of nifH amplicons in bulk soil and rhizosphere at varying depths through the soil cores showed differences in banding patterns between rhizosphere and soil material in the presence of AM. The lack of such strong differences in the benomyl-treated cores suggests that AM colonization more strongly affects the nitrogen-fixing population than do physicochemical conditions (e.g. redox potential) alone. Plant growth performance assessed by analyzing root and leaf biomass, as well as excitation transfer efficiency of open photosynthesis system II (PS II) reaction centers (Fv/Fm) was not significantly influenced by AM. Significant differences were found between treatments for C/N ratios and nitrogen content in leaf tissue. indicating that suppression of AM increased plant nitrogen acquisition.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Burke, DJ (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Warren St,Smith Hall 135, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",djburke@pegasus.rutgers.edu,,,,,,61,26,31,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2002,239,1,,,,,141,154,,10.1023/A:1014901518235,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,552PA,WOS:000175627700013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Watson, AJ; Tombleson, JD",,,,"Watson, AJ; Tombleson, JD",,,"Toppling in juvenile pines: A comparison of the root system characteristics of direct-sown seedlings, and bare-root seedlings and cuttings",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,juvenile trees; radiata pine; root allocation; root biomass; toppling; wind stability,SITKA SPRUCE; TREE STABILITY; GROWTH; ARCHITECTURE; ALLOCATION; ANCHORAGE; BIOMASS; STEM,"Three-year radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) direct-sown seedlings, bare-root seedlings and cuttings were excavated by hand from a planting trial in Taranaki, New Zealand. Eighteen trees were sampled, six of each plant type. Root system characteristics were compared by investigating differences in above- and below-ground biomass, root length, root size and root biomass distribution. No significant differences were found between plant types in total below-ground biomass, root:shoot ratio, tap root or sinker root biomass. Significant differences between plant types were found for total above-ground, branch, foliage, root bole and lateral root biomass. Additional significant differences were encountered for total root length, tap root and lateral root length. The study found the observed wind-firmness of direct-sown seedlings was unlikely to be because of the size or development of the tap root systems, the degree of symmetrical distribution of their lateral roots or higher root:shoot ratios, but could be associated with the greater proportion of total root biomass allocated to their near-stem lateral roots. It is proposed that the increase in biomass allocated to the near-stem portion of the root system, particularly on the leeward side of a tree, can be considered as an early indicator of emerging tree stability. A field-based method is suggested as a way of obtaining a measure of root anchorage. If plant types are to be developed for greater resistance to toppling, the results from this study would suggest that root stiffness, i.e. less root flexibility, should be a priority consideration in any selection or breeding programme.","Landcare Res, Canterbury, New Zealand; Forest Res, Rotorua, New Zealand","Watson, AJ (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 69, Canterbury, New Zealand.",,,,,,,47,15,16,1,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2002,239,2,,,,,187,196,,10.1023/A:1015036105630,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,540PL,WOS:000174937300003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hertel, D; Leuschner, C",,,,"Hertel, D; Leuschner, C",,,A comparison of four different fine root production estimates with ecosystem carbon balance data in a Fagus-Quercus mixed forest,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,compartmental flow calculation; fine root biomass; root necromass; ingrowth cores; minimum-maximum calculation; root growth chamber approach; sequential soil coring,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; SCOTS PINE STAND; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; IMAGINARY PROBLEM; ORGANIC-MATTER; BEECH FOREST; SOIL CORE; TURNOVER; BIOMASS; DYNAMICS,"The controversy on how to measure fine root production of forests (P) most accurately continues. We applied four different approaches to determine annual rates of P in an old-growth temperate Fagus sylvatica-Quercus petraea stand: sequential soil coring with minimum-maximum calculation, sequential coring with compartmental flow calculation, the ingrowth core method, and a recently developed root chamber method for measuring the growth of individual fine roots in situ. The results of the four destructive approaches differed by an order of magnitude and, thus, are likely to introduce large errors in estimating P. The highest annual rates of P were obtained from the sequential coring approach with compartmental flow calculation, intermediate rates by sequential coring with minimum-maximum calculation, and low ones by both the root growth chamber and ingrowth core approaches. A carbon budget for the stand was set up based on a model of annual net carbon gain by the canopy and measurements on carbon sink strength (annual leaf, branch and stem growth). The budget implied that a maximum of 27% of the net carbon gain was available for allocation to fine root growth. When compared to the carbon budget data, the sequential coring/compartmental flow approach overestimated annual fine root production substantially; whereas the ingrowth core and root growth chamber approaches grossly underestimated P rates. With an overestimation of about 25% the sequential coring/minimum-maximum approach demonstrated the best agreement with the carbon budget data. It is concluded that the most reliable estimate of P in this temperate forest will be obtained by applying the sequential coring/minimum-maximum approach, conducted with a large number of replicate samples taken on a few dates per season, in conjunction with direct root growth observation by minirhizotrons.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Hertel, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,56,109,115,0,27,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2002,239,2,,,,,237,251,,10.1023/A:1015030320845,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,540PL,WOS:000174937300008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Oba, H; Tawaraya, K; Wagatsuma, T",,,,"Oba, H; Tawaraya, K; Wagatsuma, T",,,Inhibition of pre-symbiotic hyphal growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita by root exudates of Lupinus spp.,SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Gigaspora margarita; Lupinus; non-host; root exudate,SPORE GERMINATION; PLANTS; HOST; PHOSPHORUS; INFECTION,"Effect of root exudates of Lupinus plants on hyphal growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus was investigated in order to elucidate the failure of mycorrhizal colonization in non-host plants.

Given a measure of height-growth potential, model predictions are constrained to match stand dynamics described in yield tables. Thus constrained, the model can provide reasonable annual estimates of gross photosynthesis under a specified climate, even with inexact knowledge of soil properties. If we assume that leaf litterfall and fineroot turnover approach equilibrium at canopy closure, maximum net annual ecosystem exchange can also be predicted from modeled estimates of these two detrital components and estimates of foliage, branch, stem and coarse-root production. The latter four components of production are predicted from allometric relationships with mean stem diameter. The approach is demonstrated for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stands between Ages 20 and 150 years growing under conditions typical of those at Wind River, Washington, USA. Gross photosynthesis (P(g)) by Douglas-fir at Ages 20, 70 and 150 years with leaf area indices (L) of 8.1, 6.9 and 4.0 was predicted at 1630, 1580 and 1160 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Maximum net ecosystem production (P(e)) for the same range in age classes was predicted to average 275, 294 and 207 g C m-2 year 1, respectively. The predicted reductions in L for older stands do not occur because other species fill the canopy gaps created by natural mortality of Douglas-fir. As a result of the development of an understory, total P(g) is predicted to decrease only slightly with the aging of the overstory. Estimates of P(e) exclude respiration from coarse woody debris, although additions of this component are provided annually by the model. The process-based modeling approach, constrained by yield table estimates of stand properties, sets reasonable limits on annual carbon exchange and suggests which environmental variables deserve careful monitoring to refine estimates of carbon fluxes.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Waring, RH (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",waring@fsl.orst.edu,"Waring, Richared/C-4796-2014","Waring, Richared/0000-0003-2533-3664",,,,47,54,60,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2002,22,3-Feb,,,,,179,188,,10.1093/treephys/22.2-3.179,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,522TN,WOS:000173913200012,11830414,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Klopatek, JM",,,,"Klopatek, JM",,,Belowground carbon pools and processes in different age stands of Douglas-fir,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Symposium on Aging in Pacific Northwest Forests,19-Oct-00,"OREGON STATE UNIV, CORVALLIS, OR","Western Regional Ctr, Nat Inst Global Environm Change",OREGON STATE UNIV,CO(2); forest floor; litterfall; old-growth; Pseudotsuga menziesii; root growth; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil respiration; Tsuga heterophylla; western hemlock,SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; FINE-ROOT BIOMASS; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; WESTERN OREGON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SITE PRODUCTIVITY; UNITED-STATES; BOREAL FOREST; RESPIRATION; DYNAMICS,"Forest floor material and soil organic matter may act as both a source and a sink in global CO(2) cycles. Thus, the ecosystem processes controlling these pools are central to understanding the transfers of carbon (C) between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems. To examine these ecosystem processes, the effect of stand age on temporal carbon source-sink relationships was examined in 20-year-old, 40-year-old and old-growth stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Cascade Mountains of south-central Washington State. Belowground C and nitrogen (N) storage and soil respiration were measured. In addition, nylon mesh bags containing homogenized soils from each site were buried at the respective sites to quantify root ingrowth and potential C sequestration and loss. The sites supporting the 20- and 40-year-old stands had soil C stores reflecting the C contributions from logging residue, coarse woody debris and stumps left after harvest. Because the N-fixer red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) comprised 33% of the 40-year-old stand, this site had significantly greater concentrations and pools of N in the forest floor than sites without red alder. This N-rich site had consistently lower soil CO(2) efflux rates during the growing season than the sites supporting the 20-year-old and old-growth stands. Estimated annual soil C efflux was 1367, 883 and 1194 g m(-2) for the sites supporting the 20-, 40- and old-growth stands, respectively. These values are higher than previously reported values. Root ingrowth was significantly less in the 40-year-old stand than in the 20-year-old stand, and both young stands showed markedly less fine root growth than the old-growth stand. At the sites supporting the young stands, C and N were lost from the soil bags, whereas there was an increase in C and N in the soil bags at the site supporting the old-growth stand. The fine root growth and soil respiration data support the hypothesis that belowground C allocation decreases with increasing fertility. Quantification of the source-sink relationship of soil C at the three stands based on litterfall, relative root ingrowth and soil respiration measurements was compromised because of significant CO(2) flux from decaying organic matter in the young stands.","Arizona State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Klopatek, JM (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",klopatek@asu.edu,,,,,,63,69,81,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2002,22,3-Feb,,,,,197,204,,10.1093/treephys/22.2-3.197,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,522TN,WOS:000173913200014,11830416,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Gautam, MK; Mead, DJ; Chang, SX; Clinton, PW",,,,"Gautam, MK; Mead, DJ; Chang, SX; Clinton, PW",,,Spatial variation and understorey competition effect of Pinus radiata fine roots in a silvopastoral system in New Zealand,AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine root length density (FRLD); genotype; microsite; ripping; root distribution; tree-pasture interaction,PASTURE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM; 3RD YEAR; PLANTATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; MORPHOLOGY; PATTERNS; GROWTH,"In designing agroforestry systems, the combination of tree genotype (or species) and pasture species and the spatial arrangement of trees are important considerations. The spatial variation of fine root length density (FRLD) of three radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) genotypes, referred to here as clone 3, clone 4 and seedlings, was studied in a three-year-old temperate silvopastoral experiment. The genotypes were planted with three understorey types: ryegrass (Lolium perenne) mixed with clovers (Trifolium spp), lucerne (Medicago sativa), and control (bare ground). Also fine root distribution of both tree and pasture species with soil depth and in relation to tree row (0.9 m north or south of and within the ripped tree row) was studied. Greater FRLD was found in clonal than in seedling trees in the bare ground treatment but not in the two pasture treatments, and in the 0-0.1 m but not in the 0.1-0.2 or 0.2-0.3 m soil layers. Clonal trees had a greater ability to develop a more extensive root system, especially in the 0-0.1 m soil layer, but that advantage disappeared when they were planted with pasture species since competition from the pasture species was most severe in the 0-10 cm layer. The FRLD of lucerne was greater than that of ryegrass/clovers, consistent with the greater aboveground biomass production of lucerne. Pasture species FRLD was greater on the south (wetter) than on the north side of the ripline or in the ripline. The interception of prevailing southerly rain-bearing wind by tree crowns resulted in the south side being wetter than the north side. Results indicated that production and distribution of fine roots of both tree and pasture species responded to changes in the microclimate. We suggest that to optimize pasture/tree biomass production planting trees in the north-south direction is better than in the east-west direction at the studied site.","Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Resources Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; New Zealand Forest Res Inst Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand","Chang, SX (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Ctr Enhanced Forest Management, 4-42 Earth Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",,"Clinton, Peter/D-1448-2010; Chang, Scott X/G-2029-2011","Chang, Scott/0000-0002-7624-439X; Clinton, Peter/0000-0002-8921-4835",,,,29,10,13,1,13,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Each fungus inoculated alone stimulated plant growth (height and shoot biomass). The response to the dual inoculation was greater than the response to either inoculant one. It may be due to the fact that the co-inoculated plants formed nodules through contaminations. However these nodules are inefficient as the N concentrations were similar in leaves of all inoculated plants with mycorrhizal fungi, alone and together. In thus, P, Ca, K, Mg and Na concentrations were not improved with respect to dual inoculation. The ectomycorrhizal colonization was significantly higher in the dually inoculated treatment than in either of the singly inoculated treatments.","UR IBIS Interact Biol Sols Syst Anthropises Trop, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; IRD, Lab Biopedol, Dakar, Senegal; Univ Moulay Ismail, Lab Biotechnol & Ameliorat Plantes, Meknes, Morocco; ISRA, Direct Rech Prod Forestieres, Dakar, Senegal","Duponnois, R (reprint author), UR IBIS Interact Biol Sols Syst Anthropises Trop, 01 BP182, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.",,"Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016",,,,,27,37,41,3,9,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

Most probable number, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used. A putative strain similar to inoculant strain WU96 was uncommon at one site ( South Stirling) and not isolated at 2 other sites. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) PCR fingerprinting using the RPO1 primer identified 45 different profiles amongst the 208 isolates examined. RAPD-PCR fingerprinting using the primers RPO4 and RPO5 confirmed most groupings based on RPO1 fingerprint patterns and revealed further genetic diversity within some groups. Overall, 54 putative strains were defined by RAPD-PCR fingerprint profiles across the 3 sites. Subterranean clover rhizobia at the Manypeaks and Mount Shadforth sites were dominated by isolates with 1 or 2 RPO1 RAPD profiles at 2 sampling times, while the population at South Stirling was much more diverse. The symbiotic effectiveness of 11 rhizobial isolates, representing the major RPO1 RAPD profile groups within naturalised rhizobial populations, were compared in pot culture with those of the 2 commercial inoculant strains for subterranean clover, WU95 and TA1, on 3 cultivars. Differences in effectiveness among 3 of the 11 isolates were observed in comparison to both the commercial strains and other naturalised isolates. The nitrogen fixing effectiveness of 8 isolates representing different subgroups from one RP01 group was not the same. The use of all 3 primers increased the precision in defining putative strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, and although naturalised rhizobia from these pastures are saprophytically competent, their dominance in nodules does not appear to be linked to symbiotic effectiveness.","Univ Western Australia, Ctr Legumes Mediterranean Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; Cornell Univ, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Abbott, LK (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Ctr Legumes Mediterranean Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",,"Abbott, Lynette K/F-7489-2011; Thies, Janice/A-5074-2014","Abbott, Lynette K/0000-0001-8586-7858; ",,,,23,11,11,0,9,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",Apr-73,,,AUST J SOIL RES,Aust.

Liebl. were investigated under controlled conditions. It was hypothesized that defoliation leads to a reduction of late wood and that, as a consequence, subsequent drought stress will more rapidly lead to desiccation damage due to the loss of reserves in water transport capacity. Alternatively, defoliation could have a negative effect on water relations via a growth reduction of the fine-root system, thereby diminishing the tree's capacity for water uptake. Four treatments were applied to each species: (1) control C, (2) defoliation in two consecutive years De, (3) drought stress in the second year Dr, (4) a combination of (2) and (3) DeDr. Drought-stressed trees showed a decrease of predawn and midday water potentials and of maximum stomatal conductance (g(sm)). Defoliated trees exhibited a higher g(sm), compared to non-defoliated trees even under drought-stress conditions. At the end of the drought period the daily sum of transpiration per unit leaf area (E-d) was only reduced in Dr, but not in DeDr trees, and was even increased in De trees of Q. robur. Fine-root mass, leaf mass, leaf area and specific leaf area decreased due to defoliation. Drought stress also led to a reduction of leaf mass in Q. petraea as well as to reduced leaf/fine-root ratio (Dr and DeDr trees) in both species. Although a reduction of late wood was found in DeDr trees of Q. robur and in the interannual comparison of De and DeDr twigs of Q. petraea, no restrictions of transpiration or hydraulic conductance could be observed in both species. Therefore, this finding supports the alternative hypothesis, i.e. a possible impairment of the tree's water relation caused by a reduction of the fine-root biomass due to defoliation. A combination of both stress factors impairs the morphological acclimatization to drought, i.e. an increased formation of fine-root biomass, and, partly, the physiological avoidance of dehydration, i.e. a reduction in stomatal conductance. Therefore, it is concluded that, in contrast to an isolated occurence of the stressors, their combined action - depending on the time of occurrence of the stressors - will ultimately result in tree damage due to desiccation.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Res, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Gieger, T (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",,"Thomas, Frank/H-8418-2019",,,,,41,26,32,3,45,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",1439-1791,,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

But the root systems may change if more than one species is present. The fine root system (d < 2mm) of spruce was characterized for pure stands and for comparable mixed spruce/beech stands to a soil depth of 80 cm. This made it possible to estimate the effects of interspecific competition on stagnic cambisol and on dystric cambisol, respectively. An additional pure beech stand was studied on stagnic cambisol to evaluate the mixture effect also on the root system of beech. The total fine root biomass was greater in each mixed stand compared to the neighbouring pure stand. Fine roots of beech were over-represented in the rooting zone of the mixed stand, which indicates a competitive displacement of fine roots of spruce. In addition, spruce developed a more superficially distributed root system in the mixed compared to the pure stands. The low abundance of spruce roots in mixed stand and the limitation of spruce roots to the uppermost soil layers underlines the high competitive ability of beech in the rooting zone of the investigated mixed stands.","Univ Ulm, Dept Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany","Schmid, I (reprint author), Univ Ulm, Dept Systemat Bot & Ecol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",,,,,,,46,78,92,4,36,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",1439-1791,,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

The increase mostly involved small stems, but neither seedlings nor very small plants were observed suggesting that stem increase was largely due to vegetative reproduction by rhizomes and/or root tips. These data correspond to expectation since populations have not expanded rapidly nor spread substantially over the past few decades, but rather appear to have expanded slightly and slowly. Corresponding to earlier speculation, evidence is accumulating to suggest that substantial spreading and large population increases may be dependent on specific kinds and levels of disturbance some of which are no longer prevalent or frequent.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; Agr & Agri Food Canada, Eastern Cereal & Oilseed Res Ctr, Res Branch, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada","Sinclair, A (reprint author), Box 214, Metcalfe, ON K0A 2P0, Canada.",,,,,,,12,6,6,0,4,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,OTTAWA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",Aug-50,,,CAN FIELD NAT,Can.

The objective of this study was to determine and evaluate forest net primary production (NPP) in the three Prairie Provinces in west-central Canada, as estimated by the model. The model simulated an averaged aboveground NPP (NPPA) of 172 g C.m(-2.)year(-1) for the regional forests, varying from 72 to 293 g C.m(-2.)year(-1), depending on ecoclimatic province, forest type, age, and site productivity. Comparisons of NPPA estimates for the boreal forest (165-179 g C.m(-2.)year(-1)) with results from direct measurements, modeling, and empirical calculations show that the CBM-CFS2 produced reasonable estimates of NPPA. The model incorporates different types of disturbances such as wildfire, harvesting, and insects and is able to evaluate NPP changes with stand age. However, belowground NPP may be overestimated, especially for young and unproductive stands. This can be explained by the current parameter estimates for the fine-root component of belowground biomass and for fine-root turnover rates.","Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada; Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada","Li, Z (reprint author), Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, 5320-122 St, Edmonton, AB T6H 3S5, Canada.",,,"Kurz, Werner/0000-0003-4576-7849; Banfield, Ed/0000-0001-8252-0509",,,,43,21,23,0,9,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

However, some concerns have been expressed regarding changes in root growth in the artificial soil environment created in ingrowth-cores. In this study, the effects that homogenization and compaction of soil might have on fine-root growth and morphology of black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) were examined. Fine-root (<2mm) morphology was characterized by diameter and internode length. There was no difference in fine-root biomass and morphology between conventional ingrowth-cores (soil sieved and homogenized) and compacted cores (soil density increased by one third). However, fine-root biomass was substantially higher in ingrowth-cores in which the soil was distributed in layers of different fertility (patchy treatment) and both diameter and internode length values were closer to that found in the undisturbed soil cores. In the heterogenous treatment, the root internode length and biomass was significantly higher in rich patches than in poor patches. Our results indicate that fine-root production assessment using conventional ingrowth-cores where the soil is sieved and homogenized may underestimate the true production found in undisturbed soil. Fine-root architectural parameters in the patchy treatment were more similar to those found in the undisturbed soil cores. This study suggests that stratification or increased patchiness of the ingrowth-core growing medium should better mimic the conditions associated in undisturbed soils.","Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Australian Natl Univ, Dept Forestry, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Messier, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, CP 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",,"Bauhus, Jurgen/G-4449-2013","Bauhus, Jurgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",,,,30,4,4,0,5,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Our study tested hypotheses that detrital biomass and microbial immobilization of N function as larger N sinks and correspond to greater N retention in old-growth compared to maturing second-growth forests. Aboveground living and detrital biomass pools were greater in old-growth compared to second-growth forest, a difference due largely to coarse woody debris (CWD). The total amount of N in detrital pools was significantly greater in old-growth than second-growth forests. We also found more rapid rates of microbial N immobilization in old-growth forests than in second-growth forests. In situ net N mineralization ranged widely among individual stands and did not differ between old- and second-growth forests.

Nitrate leaching losses were significantly related to soil NO3- pools, litterfall N flux, and fine root biomass across both old- and second-growth forest stands. We conclude that CWD and microbial N uptake and turnover are greater N sinks in old-growth than in second-growth forests. This apparent N sink was not the primary factor influencing N leaching loss. however. Patterns of N dynamics among individual forest ecosystems indicate that N losses correspond to net rates of N mineralization and to litterfall N flux (indicators of plant N cycling), which are independent of forest age, biomass pools. and gross N transformations at the successional stages that we compared.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Fisk, MC (reprint author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, 572 Rivers St, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Fisk, Melany/0000-0003-4248-0180; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,76,52,57,5,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2002,83,1,,,,,73,87,,10.2307/2680122,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,508YQ,WOS:000173117700008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Gange, AC; Stagg, PG; Ward, LK",,,,"Gange, AC; Stagg, PG; Ward, LK",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi affect phytophagous insect specialism,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,insect; arbuscular mycorrhiza; specialism; multitrophic interactions,LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; HOST SPECIALIZATION; PLANTS; HERBIVORE; SEQUENCES,"The majority of phytophagous insects eat very few plant species, yet the ecological and evolutionary forces that have driven such specialism are not entirely understood.

Seedlings were individually labelled when emerging after fire and extracted three years later, when they achieved the sapling phase. In order to evaluate the influence of inter-specific competition from C. monspeliensis on the P. halepensis root system, a stratified sampling was carried out on the basis of variability in density and height of saplings: patches were selected according to C. monspeliensis density, and pines attending to their stem height. Topological parameters considered in the analysis were magnitude, total external pathlength, and altitude of the root system. Results clearly evidenced greater plasticity in root system topology of P. halepensis than C. monspeliensis saplings. Herringbone architecture (i.e., the most ordered pattern possible, with branching confined to the main axis) characterised small pine saplings, regardless of competition from C. monspeliensis, and changed to random branching throughout sapling development. In middle growth stages, however, the root system was affected by interspecific competition, which delayed configuration changes in root branching. In contrast, C. monspeliensis invariably adopted randomly branched architecture, regardless of intra-competition intensity. Functional and ecological implications in the post-fire secondary succession context are discussed.","Univ Castilla La Mancha, ETS Ingenieros Agron, Dpt Prod Vegetal & Tecnol Agr, Albacete 02071, Spain","Ferrandis, P (reprint author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, ETS Ingenieros Agron, Dpt Prod Vegetal & Tecnol Agr, Campus Univ S-N, Albacete 02071, Spain.",,,,,,,27,2,2,0,5,BACKHUYS PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 321, 2300 AH LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-5782-116-8,,,,2002,,,,,,,265,276,,,,,12,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry; Soil Science,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Agriculture,BV13K,WOS:000177912100023,,,,,10/31/19J,"Holscher, D; Hertel, D; Leuschner, C; Hottkowitz, M",,,,"Holscher, D; Hertel, D; Leuschner, C; Hottkowitz, M",,,Tree species diversity and soil patchiness in a temperate broad-leaved forest with limited rooting space,FLORA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fagus sylvatica; fine roots; leaf area; root competition; scree; Tilia platyphyllos,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PINE PLANTATION; FINE ROOTS; COMPETITION; GROWTH; BEECH; BIODIVERSITY; RICHNESS; BIOMASS; STAND,"In natural forest communities of Central Europe, Fagus sylvatica predominates in the tree layer under a wide range of site conditions due to a remarkable competitive ability. An exception are skeleton-rich soils such as screes where several other broad-leaved tree species co-exist with, or even replace, F. sylvatica. Little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the stable co-existence of 4-6 or more tree species on these sites. In a Tilia-Fagus-Fraxinus-Acer-Ulmus forest on a scree (stone content 57 vol. %), we analysed the above- and below-ground biomass structure. and the horizontal distribution of the tree fine root systems. Fine roots were identified on the species level by means of morphological attributes. In the highly patchy soil we assessed the evidence for below-ground habitat partitioning which might promote species co-existence. Tilia platyphyllos accounted for 46% of the stems and 40% of the total leaf area, whereas F. sylvatica reached 42% of the leaf area with a much lower stem density (24% of the stand total). T platyphyllos was the dominant species in the rhizosphere with 56% of the total fine root biomass in the topsoil (0-10 cm depth). F. sylvatica contributed only 19% to the fine root biomass despite its extensive leaf area. The other 4 species held further 18% of the leaf area and 25% of the fine root biomass. The fine root systems of the trees showed stem-centred distribution patterns with low root densities at distances > 5.5 In, and a remarkably small overlap among the co-existing species. In 22% of all soil samples we found no tree roots at all. roots of only one species were present in 62% of the samples, roots of two or more species were confined to only 16% of the collective. Compared to other Central European mono-specific F. sylvatica forests with a less restricted soil volume, the scree forest was characterised by a low average fine root density, a high proportion of root-free soil patches and very high local fine root densities. Our results indicate a spatial segregation of the fine root systems of neighbouring trees due to a high stone content which may reduce root competition in this mixed stand. we Suggest that partitioning of below-ground rooting space due to physical barriers is a mechanism that promotes tree species diversity in Central European forests on skeleton-rich and patchy soils.","Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Kassel, FB 19, D-34132 Kassel, Germany","Holscher, D (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht Von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",,,,,,,35,36,40,0,30,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",0367-2530,,,FLORA,Flora,,2002,197,2,,,,,118,125,,10.1078/0367-2530-00021,,,8,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,535PX,WOS:000174653800004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kuen, V; Erschbamer, B",,,,"Kuen, V; Erschbamer, B",,,Comparative study between morphology and age of Trifolium pallescens in a glacier foreland of the Central Alps,FLORA,,,English,Article,,,,,,alpine; glacier foreland; herbchronology; population structure; reproductive threshold; r-selection,THALII VILL; REPRODUCTION; PERSISTANCE; STRATEGIES; SEEDLINGS; SCHREB,"On the glacier foreland of the Rotmoosferner (Obergurgl, Tyrol, Austria) Trifolium pallescens populations were analysed on the moraines of 1971, 1923 and 1858.

The age of the individuals was determined by means of herbchronology, i.e. the annual growth rings of the roots were determined. The highest number of individuals per square metre was found on the moraine of 1923. According to the size class distribution an invading population, an optimal stage and a regressive population were recognized. Significant differences in the size of the individuals were detected between the moraines, the tallest individuals and the largest rosettes being on the oldest moraine. A significant correlation was found between age and root diameter. This parameter could be used for age calibrations. Reproduction was found to be size-dependent and not age-dependent.

Shoot water potential (WP), root electrolyte leakage (REL) and root growth potential (RGP) were assessed. In addition, the survival and height increment of seedlings established in a field trial in tandem with the physiology work was determined after one growing season. Shoot WP of freshly lifted ash seedlings, but not sycamore, decreased to low values in the winter. REL and RGP values were generally also lower in ash than in sycamore on most lift dates. Furthermore, sycamore became more highly active earlier in the year (February/March) than ash (April/May). The effect of cold storage on physiological responses was not consistent. The survival of seedlings in the field was close to 100 per cent regardless of treatment. The height increment of freshly lifted sycamore was best for stock planted from September to early March, whereas ash grew best when planted early (October-November) or late (after February) in the lifting season, although differences between most lift dates were small in ash. Under operational forestry conditions, planting during some of these periods may not be advisable due to the potential effect of handling damage. Cold-stored ash planted in May after cold storage performed well for seedlings lifted to the store from December to February, but the physiologically more active sycamore performed best when stored from February.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Sci Hort & Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland; Eurofortech, Dublin 1, Ireland; Coillte Teo, Div Res & Dev, Newtownmountkennedy, Co Wicklow, Ireland","O'Reilly, C (reprint author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Fac Agr, Dept Crop Sci Hort & Forestry, Dublin 4, Ireland.",,,,,,,46,17,19,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,,,FORESTRY,Forestry,,2002,75,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1093/forestry/75.1.1,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,524TE,WOS:000174028300001,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Radoglou, K; Raftoyannis, Y",,,,"Radoglou, K; Raftoyannis, Y",,,"The impact of storage, desiccation and planting date on seedling quality and survival of woody plant species",FORESTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ELECTROLYTE LEAKAGE; SPRUCE SEEDLINGS; COLD-STORAGE; ROOT; ESTABLISHMENT; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; PINE,"A comparative study of nine tree species was carried out to investigate the effects of ambient storage, desiccation and planting date on seedling quality.

A review of the literature suggests that the major difference between irregular and regular stands is the lower (i.e. more stable) height : diameter ratio associated with the dominant trees in the former. This appears to be a consequence of the greater wind loading that these dominant trees have to withstand. Wind tunnel studies show no difference in wind profile within or above the two types of canopy. There have been few comparative root investigations in the two types of stand and no differences in rooting depth have been reported, although changes in root architecture could be anticipated as a result of greater wind loading. The implications of these findings upon windthrow risk in regular and irregular Sitka spruce stands has been explored using the Forest GALES wind risk model on sites of different wind exposure. The results suggest no difference in wind risk on sheltered sites. On sites of moderate exposure, an irregular stand at close to 'steady state' conditions could be more wind stable than a conventionally thinned regular stand. However, this advantage disappears with increasing exposure. The conclusion is that the promotion of irregular stands may provide structures with more stable characteristics, but these cannot be considered in isolation from the prevailing wind climate and the local site type.","No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland","Mason, WL (reprint author), No Res Stn, Roslin EH25 9SY, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,,,,45,61,67,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0015-752X,,,FORESTRY,Forestry,,2002,75,4,,,,,347,355,,10.1093/forestry/75.4.347,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,613EN,WOS:000179119300004,,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Rasmuson, KE; Anderson, JE",,,,"Rasmuson, KE; Anderson, JE",,,"Salinity affects development, growth, and photosynthesis in cheatgrass",JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass partitioning; Bromus tectorum; intraspecific variation; developmental response; root growth; photosynthetic rates; population differences; salt stress; stomatal conductance,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; BROMUS-TECTORUM L; SALT TOLERANCE; NON-HALOPHYTES; NORTH-AMERICA; GAS-EXCHANGE; NACL STRESS; LEAVES,"The effects, of salt stress on growth and development of cheat-grass (Bromus tectorum L.) were investigated in 2 greenhouse studies. The first study assessed developmental and physiological responses of this grass to 4 salinity levels. Salinity stunted growth through reduced leaf initiation and expansion, and reduced photosynthetic rates. Reduction of photosynthetic rates appeared to be primarily due to stomatal limitation. Salinity also reduced carbon isotope discrimination, indicating long-term effects on conductance and carbon gain. Root growth was severely inhibited by high salinity, resulting in a shift in the root to shoot allocation pattern. The second study investigated growth patterns of cheatgrass in relation to intraspecific variation in salt tolerance using plants grown from seeds collected at non-saline and saline sites. Salinity reduced growth of plants from both environments. However, plants from the saline site accumulated leaf and root area at nearly twice the rate as those from the non-saline site, even in the control group. Because plants were grown in a common environment, growth differences between populations were genetically based. Thus, the potential for rapid growth may enable plants from the saline site to rely on shallow, less saline moisture reserves available early in the growing season.","Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; Bechtel SAIC Co, LLC, Las Vegas, NV 89144 USA","Rasmuson, KE (reprint author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",,,,,,,35,20,22,0,11,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

Statistical models were used to quantify the relationship between soil properties and expert-derived values for tree growth. Sixteen physical and chemical soil properties of 68 soils found in southern Illinois were used, along with published site index values, in a multivariate stepwise multiple regression analysis. The tree species selected for estimated site index regression were white oak (Quercus alba L.), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.). These tree species were chosen based on availability of site index data, the site conditions required by the species, and ability to allow the prediction of tree growth for all soil series in the area. Stepwise regression procedures were used to select the most important soil parameters for each species productivity estimate from 16 original physical and chemical soil properties. The most important soil parameters in models to extrapolate site index predictions were total rooting depth, thickness of the A horizon, bulk density of the A and E horizon, bulk density of the subsoil, and percentage clay found in the B horizon. The parameter estimates were used to construct site index prediction equations. The soil property equations explained 61% of the variation in white oak site index estimates, 70% of northern red oak site index estimates, and 80% of the variation in site index estimates of yellow poplar. The projected productivity estimates will be useful to land managers who wish to allocate time and other resources to land based on the potential productivity of the site. Use of this method resulted in free height growth projections for many soils published in regional soil surveys, including soils that currently lack forest cover and have high seasonal water tables or are subject to flooding.","Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Woolery, ME (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,30,8,12,0,5,SOIL WATER CONSERVATION SOC,ANKENY,"7515 N E ANKENY RD, ANKENY, IA 50021-9764 USA",0022-4561,,,J SOIL WATER CONSERV,J.

The population structure of both species changed much more with depth than leaf morphology and physiology. Leaf biomass declined 5- to 7-fold along the depth gradient reducing self-shading within the canopy, whereas the leaf area per unit leaf biomass and the photosynthesis-light response varied less than 1.5-fold among depths. Moreover, C. nodosa developed a greater proportion of leaves relative to rhizomes and roots at greater depths, thereby promoting the balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the shoots. C. nodosa, being a potentially fast-growing species compared to P. oceanica, had higher maximum photosynthetic and respiration rates as well as light compensation points for photosynthesis. Photosynthetic efficiency at low light, however, was almost the same for the 2 species as suggested by the relatively small differences in mass-specific light absorption. Only C. nodosa acclimated physiologically to depth as light-use efficiency increased, and light compensation point declined significantly from shallow to deep water. P. oceanica, however, possessed low respiration rates and slightly lower light compensation points values than C. nodosa throughout the depth range. Shoot mortality and recruitment rates were unaffected by rooting depth. C. nodosa stand experienced fast shoot turnover compared to R oceanica, and shoot longevity of the former species decreased significantly with depth, suggesting higher risk of patch mortality at the depth limit. In contrast, F oceanica shoot longevity was highest at great depths. Overall, these species differences in leaf metabolism and shoot dynamics suggest that C. nodosa responds faster to changing light conditions, whereas P. oceanica is able to survive longer at low irradiance due to low growth and respiratory maintenance rates.","Univ Aarhus, Dept Plant Ecol, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, Mexico; Univ Balearic Isl, Inst Mediterrano Estudios Avanzados, SCIC, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain; Univ Copenhagen, Freshwater Biol Lab, DK-3400 Hillerod, Denmark","Olesen, B (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Plant Ecol, Nordlandsvej 68, DK-8240 Risskov, Denmark.",birgit.olesen@biology.au.dk,"Olesen, Birgit/K-1997-2013; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/F-3041-2015","Olesen, Birgit/0000-0002-8864-6716; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/0000-0003-2534-4638; Enriquez, Susana/0000-0001-5776-902X",,,,48,92,94,0,34,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Our objective was to assess whether there are consistent evolutionary patterns in structure of seedling root systems in species from different rainfall environments when examined across multiple evolutionary lineages. Seedlings were grown to a standardised developmental stage under controlled conditions. We found that seedling root systems of species restricted to low rainfall environments are characterised by greater proportional allocation to main root axis and have proportionally smaller main root axis diameter and areas of stele and xylem. Species of low rainfall environments also had higher specific root length (SRL) of the main axis, but lower SRL when the entire root system was considered. Seedling root system elongation rates were higher in species of high rainfall relative to those of low rainfall environments, paralleling expected differences in relative growth rate. The higher root system elongation rates in species of high rainfall environments were associated with greater numbers of growing tips in the root system, but not with differences in elongation rates of individual tips, relative to species of low rainfall environments.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Macquarie Univ, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Nicotra, AB (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",adrienne.nicotra@anu.edu.au,"Nicotra, Adrienne B/C-1361-2009","Nicotra, Adrienne B/0000-0001-6578-369X; Westoby, Mark/0000-0001-7690-4530",,,,39,84,88,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,2002,130,1,,,,,136,145,,10.1007/s004420100788,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,507MP,WOS:000173032500015,28547018,,,,10/31/19J,"Cheng, Y; Watkin, ELJ; O'Hara, GW; Howieson, JG",,,,"Cheng, Y; Watkin, ELJ; O'Hara, GW; Howieson, JG",,,Medicago sativa and Medicago murex differ in the nodulation response to soil acidity,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,lucerne; Medicago murex; N-fixation; nodule initials; rhizobia; soil pH,RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; ALFALFA ROOTS; RED-CLOVER; SYMBIOSIS; CALCIUM; PH; TOLERANCE; FIXATION; LEGUMES; CULTURE,"Nodulation of Medicago sativa by Sinorhizobium meliloti is challenged by acidity, but the ability of M. murex to nodulate in acid soils provided the opportunity to compare the symbiotic development between the two species in an acid sandy soil.

Abiotic and biotic conditions in the stands were assessed at two scales, tree plot (5 in x 5 in) and microsite (1 m x 1 m), along with presence, density and height of white spruce seedlings. Germination and survival of seed sown 1- and 4-years post fire were quantified. Survival and growth of nursery-grown seedlings, and mycorrhizal colonization, survival and growth of sterile seedlings, planted 1-year post-fire were assessed. At the tree plot scale, presence of white spruce seedlings 1-year post-fire could be reliably predicted by organic layer depth and distance to and strength of seed source. In contrast, none of the biotic or abiotic factors measured was strongly correlated with occurrence or density of white spruce seedlings 6- and 14- years post-fire. At the microsite scale, seedling recruitment immediately post-fire was limited to a distinct subset of available microsites (greater % cover of downed wood and moss, lower % cover of litter and herbaceous vegetation). Likewise, seedling occurrence in older bums was associated with distinct microsite conditions; although this was more likely an effect of white spruce presence, rather than the cause. Less than 3% of seed sown 1 yr post-fire survived to become 1 yr old germinants, survival was 41% over the next three years. Availability of suitable regeneration microsites declines rapidly with time-since-fire; less than 0.3% of seed sown 4 yrs post-fire survived one year. High rates of mycorrhizal colonization were found on white spruce seedlings planted 1-year post-fire, including early and late stage fungal species. Micrositc characteristics were only weakly correlated with mycorrhizal fungal communities. We propose that immediate post-fire recruitment of white spruce is a key process in mixedwood boreal succession.","Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Purdy, BG (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",ellen.macdonald@ualberta.ca,,,,,,61,51,53,0,20,FINNISH SOC FOREST SCIENCE-NATURAL RESOURCES INST FINLAND,VANTAA,"PO BOX 18, FI-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND",0037-5330,2242-4075,,SILVA FENN,Silva.

In addition, spores of Gi. margarita contained large quantities of 18:1omega9c and three 20-C fatty acids (20:1omega9c, 20:2omega6c and 22:1omega9c) that were not present in the spores of the other two species. Addition of a known number of spores of each AM species to soil demonstrated that the spore fatty acids could be readily detected and quantified against the background of soil fatty acids. Addition of different combinations and quantities of spores to soil gave the expected ratios of the marker fatty acids in the soil FAME profiles. The results confirm the use of 16:1omega5c as a marker fatty acid for AM fungi in controlled environments and suggest that 18:1omega9c, 20:1omega9c, 20:2omega6c and 22:1omega9c could be used as possible markers for the detection of Gi. margarita.

We separated clay-sized fractions from a vertisol, an alfisol and an oxisol after complete dispersion of the soils by mechanical means and purified the toxin from a Btt commercial preparation. Adsorption isotherms were established by the difference method in deionized water or in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Adsorption of Btt toxin was in the order: vertisol > alfisol > oxisol, and it was mostly irreversible, except for the alfisol. Adsorption could be explained by physicochemical conditions (pH and ionic strength) and the nature of clay constituents, i.e., the dominant clay mineralogy: montmorillonite (vertisol) and kaolinite (alfisol, oxisol). The results show that Bt toxins released into the soil may be retained by soil colloids. The impact of such adsorption on biodegradation and pesticidal activity should be studied.","INRA, Unite Sci Sol, F-78026 Versailles, France","Chenu, C (reprint author), INRA, Unite Sci Sol, F-78026 Versailles, France.",,"Muchaonyerwa, Pardon/K-1292-2012","CALAMAI, LUCA/0000-0002-0402-4873",,,,23,4,5,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0918,,0-444-51039-7,DEV SOIL SCI,,,2002,28B,,,,,,59,68,,,,,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,BV07Z,WOS:000177767000004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Burton, AJ; Pregitzer, KS",,,,"Burton, AJ; Pregitzer, KS",,,Measurement carbon dioxide concentration does not affect root respiration of nine tree species in the field,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Acer saccharum; direct effect of CO2 J; Juniperus monosperma; Picea glauca; Pinus edulis; Pinus elliottii; Pinus resinosa; Populus balsamifera; Quercus alba; Quercus rubra,DIRECT INHIBITION; ELEVATED CO2; MAINTENANCE RESPIRATION; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; FINE-ROOT; IN-SITU; LEAVES; TISSUE,"Inhibition of respiration has been reported as a short-term response of tree roots to elevated measurement CO2 concentration ([CO2]), calling into question the validity of root respiration rates determined at CO2 concentrations that differ from the soil [CO2] in the rooting zone. Our objectives were to validate previous observations of a direct CO2 effect on root respiration in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and to determine if high [CO2] also inhibited root respiration in other tree species. Root respiration rates for nine common North American tree species were measured in the field at ambient soil temperature at both 350 and 1000 mul CO2 l(-1). No evidence of direct inhibition of root respiration by elevated measurement [CO2] was found for any of the species tested. The ratio of respiration rates at 1000 and 350 mul CO2 l(-1) ranged from 0.97 to 1.07, and the 95% confidence intervals for this ratio included unity for all species tested. Tests of a respiration cuvette used in earlier experiments suggested that gas leakage from the cuvette/IRGA system created an apparent direct CO2 effect on respiration of sugar maple roots when none actually existed. Small sample masses used in those experiments exacerbated the error. Careful attention to the possibility of gas leaks and the avoidance of small sample masses should produce data that will allow researchers to accurately assess whether direct effects of measurement [CO2] exist. Our findings of no direct CO2 effect on respiration of roots of a wide variety of species suggest that such effects may be less common than previously thought for tree roots.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Burton, AJ (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",,,"Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997",,,,17,41,53,0,15,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JAN,2002,22,1,,,,,67,72,,10.1093/treephys/22.1.67,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,519TG,WOS:000173741100008,11772557,Bronze,,,10/31/19B,"Scott, HS; Carey, PD",,"Kindlmann, P; Willems, JH; Whigham, DF",,"Scott, HS; Carey, PD",,,The effects of fungicide and water application on seed germination and infection in Gymnadenia conopsea under field conditions,TRENDS AND FLUCTUATIONS AND UNDERLYING MECHANISMS IN TERRESTRIAL ORCHID POPULATIONS,,,English,Proceedings Paper,Conference on Trends and Fluctuations and Underlying Mechanisms in Terrestrial Orchid Populations,"MAY 06-13, 2001","CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,benomyl; germination; Gymnadenia conopsea; mycorrhizal fungi; orchid; soil moisture,PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ORCHIDACEAE; POPULATION; ECOLOGY; ENGLAND; L.,"The germination of orchid seeds is enhanced by the infection of mycorrhizal fungi. If different fungi show differential responses to fungicide, the application of fungicide to grassland might be expected to have an effect on levels of infection and germination. Seeds of Gymnadenia conopsea (L.) R. BR. were sown in vivo in seed packets and retrieved at 4 weekly intervals. Sets of seed packets were subjected to three treatments: spraying with benomyl; water; and no treatment. Packets from each treatment were analysed for percentage germination and infection by mycorrhizal fungi. The application of benomyl significantly enhanced the infection of seeds by mycorrhizal fungi that showed high resistance to the fungicide. The largest effect on the infection of seeds and germination came from the addition of water, either with or without benomyl, at the beginning of the experiment. The results suggest that orchid seeds need moisture near the soil surface soon after they land if they are to become infected by mycorrhizal fungi and germinate. The fungicide benomyl alters the proportion of seeds infected and the proportion of infected seeds that germinate. A possible mechanism is that pathogenic fungi are removed and replaced by the fungi that allow germination.","Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England","Scott, HS (reprint author), Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NS, Kent, England.",,,,,,,26,6,6,0,2,BACKHUYS PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 321, 2300 AH LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",,,90-5782-123-0,,,,2002,,,,,,,155,165,,,,,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Horticulture,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,BW10G,WOS:000180884300011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Egerton-Warburton, LM; Graham, RC; Allen, EB; Allen, MF",,,,"Egerton-Warburton, LM; Graham, RC; Allen, EB; Allen, MF",,,Reconstruction of the historical changes in mycorrhizal fungal communities under anthropogenic nitrogen deposition,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; diversity; nitrogen saturation; community variation,AIR-POLLUTION; CARBON; ECOSYSTEMS; CALIFORNIA; PLANT; GRASSLAND; FOREST; OZONE; CONSEQUENCES; RESPONSES,"Archived soil samples (1937-1999) and historic air quality data from the Los Angeles Basin were used for reconstructing the record of change between atmospheric NOx loads, soil delta N-15 values and the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), which are ubiquitous plant fungus mutualists that control plant community productivity. A tripling of atmospheric NOx loads between 1937 and the 1970s was paralleled by soil nitrogen enrichment (delta N-15 = 3.18). From 1975 onwards, atmospheric NOx declined, but soils became nitrogen saturated (delta N-15 = - 4 and NO3-nitrogen = 171 mg kg(-1)). The shifts in the ANI community followed 28 years of atmospheric nitrogen enrichment and coincided kith the onset of soil nitrogen saturation. Such changes were manifest in the loss of ANI productivity, species richness (one species per year), three genera (Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora) in the spore community and Gigaspora within the roots. Nitrogen enrichment also enhanced the proliferation of potentially less mutualistic species of Glomus. Autoregressive models implied that such patterns swill persist and be driven by soil nitrogen cycling patterns. Chronic nitrogen enrichment from air pollution thus alters the diversity and mutualistic functioning of ANI communities, which, in turn, may influence the plant community.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; Chicago Bot Gardens, Conservat Biol Dept, Glencoe, IL 60022 USA","Egerton-Warburton, LM (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",lwarburton@chicagobotanic.org,,,,,,40,40,41,2,41,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Thus, studies that address factors regulating belowground processes are especially relevant for tallgrass prairie. We predicted that effects of grazing and burning differ belowground and that changes in root productivity caused by burning or grazing provide feedback that affects ecosystem fluxes of C and N. These differences in belowground response should be driven largely by changes in N dynamics and the degree to which burning and grazing affect the pathway and magnitude of N loss and the degree of N limitation in these systems. Fire. the major pathway of N loss in ungrazed tallgrass prairie, should result in reduced net N mineralization and N availability. We expected plants to compensate for increased N limitation by increasing their allocation to roots, as manifested in increased soil respiration and C cycling belowground. In contrast, grazing conserves N in the ecosystem by redistributing the N once contained in grass to labile forms in urine and dung. Thus, we predicted that grazing should increase N cycling rates and N availability to plants. Consequently, grazed plants should be less N limited and should allocate less C to roots and more to shoots. This, in turn, should decrease belowground C cycling, manifested as reduced soil CO2 flux. We explored the roles of grazing and burning on root growth in experimental watersheds at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA. To assess effects of fire on root productivity, we installed root ingrowth cores in two watersheds without grazers that differ in fire frequency: annually vs. infrequently burned (four years since the last fire). To assess effects of grazing, we installed root ingrowth cores in an annually burned watershed grazed by bison and in fenced controls (exclosures). Within bison ""grazing lawns,"" root ingrowth cores were installed in lightly and heavily grazed patches. Concurrently, we measured in situ rates of net N mineralization and soil respiration as indices of soil N and C cycling. Annual burning resulted in a 25% increase in root growth compared to the unburned watershed (four years since last fire), as plants compensated for N limitation by increasing allocation to roots. Grazing had the opposite effect: it decreased root growth, especially in heavily grazed patches (similar to 30% less than in fenced controls). Grazing by ungulates increased N cycling and availability. Therefore, grazed plants, instead of being N limited, experienced C limitation as shoots regrew and plants allocated less C to roots. Interestingly, root ingrowth on the long-term unburned watershed was as low as in lightly grazed patches in the grazed watershed. Thus, seemingly disparate treatments such as infrequent burning (characterized by accumulation of detritus aboveground) and grazing (periodic biomass removal) both had higher levels of N availability than annually burned prairie in the absence of grazers. Root growth in unburned and grazed watersheds must be limited by resources other than N (e.g., C in grazing lawns or light in infrequently burned prairie). Burning and grazing also altered root tissue chemistry in contrasting ways that further accentuated the root growth differences caused by these treatments. Frequent fires lowered substrate quality of roots (C:N = 60), thus increasing N limitation. In contrast, grazing and infrequent burning improved root tissue quality (C:N = 40), promoting faster cycling of N. These large differences in root growth and tissue chemistry can result in profound ecosystem-level changes. Grazing increased net N mineralization rates from 87% to 617% compared to watersheds without grazers, whereas annual burning decreased it by similar to 50% compared to unburned prairie. Although grazing speeded up N cycling, it reduced soil respiration by 50% compared to fenced controls, presumably because of reduced root mass. On the other hand, annual burning increased soil respiration, presumably because of increased root biomass. Ultimately, differences in the quantity and quality of roots provide feedback to affect C and N cycling and help to maintain and even promote the fundamental differences in N cycling between burning and grazing in tallgrass prairie.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; USDA, NRCS, Lakota, ND 58344 USA","Johnson, LC (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,,,,,,73,219,231,3,182,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2001,82,12,,,,,3377,3389,,10.2307/2680159,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,503GY,WOS:000172791800009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bakker, J; Wilson, S",,,,"Bakker, J; Wilson, S",,,Competitive abilities of introduced and native grasses,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agropyron cristatum; Bouteloua gracilis; competition; mixed-grass prairie; water,BLUE GRAMA SEEDLINGS; CRESTED WHEATGRASS; BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; WESTERN WHEATGRASS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; GREAT-PLAINS; SOIL-WATER; PLANT; GRASSLAND; PRAIRIE,"Differences in competitive ability may explain the maintenance of existing plant populations and the invasion of new areas by plant species. We used field experiments to examine the competitive responses of Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., an introduced C-3 grass, and Bouteloua gracilis (HBK.) Lag., a native C-4 grass, and the competitive effects of Agropyron-dominated vegetation and successional prairie. We also tested whether the outcome of competitive interactions varied with water availability. In each vegetation type, transplants of each species were grown under two levels of competition (presence or absence of neighboring vegetation) and three levels of water availability (high, medium, or low). Transplant survival, growth, and biomass allocation patterns were measured. Water availability had no effect on the measured variables, suggesting that both species were limited by another resource. Growth rates were affected more by competition, while survival and root: shoot ratio were affected more by transplant species identity. In the successional prairie, neighboring vegetation suppressed the growth of Agropyron transplants less than that of Bouteloua transplants, suggesting that Agropyron has a stronger ability to resist competitive suppression in that vegetation type. The spread of Agropyron into surrounding vegetation may relate to its ability to resist competitive suppression. In the Agropyron-dominated vegetation, neighboring vegetation suppressed the growth of both species by the same extent. However, competition accounted for more variation in transplant growth in Agropyron-dominated vegetation than in successional prairie, suggesting that Agropyron has strong competitive effects which hinder plant growth and prevent other species from establishing in Agropyron fields.","Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; TRP Forestry Consultants, Vernon, BC V1T 1J4, Canada","Wilson, S (reprint author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",,"Bakker, Jonathan/I-6960-2013","Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771",,,,41,65,75,0,32,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,DEC,2001,157,2,,,,,117,125,,10.1023/A:1013972403293,,,9,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,515TX,WOS:000173513700001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zhang, ZQ; Shu, WS; Lan, CY; Wong, MH",,,,"Zhang, ZQ; Shu, WS; Lan, CY; Wong, MH",,,Soil seed bank as an input of seed source in revegetation of lead/zinc mine tailings,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,soil seed bank; mine tailings; revegetation,WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; RESTORATION; ESTABLISHMENT; SUCCESSION; VEGETATION; BAUXITE; FOREST; JAPAN; SITE; EAST,"The goal of the present study was to assess a soil seed bank as an input seed source for revegetating lead/zinc (Pb/Zh) mine tailings. The seed bank source was abandoned farmland, whose top 10-cm layer of topsoil contained 6,850 +/- 377 seeds/m(2) from 41 species. The seeds in the soil were principally distributed in the upper 0-2 cm, which held 75.8% of total seeds and 92.7% of species composition. The top 2-cm layer of topsoil may be sufficient to serve the purpose of providing a seed source for revegetation on derelict lands, including mined lands. Four different thicknesses of topsoil (1, 2, 4, and 8 cm, redistributed from the total 0-10-cm layer from the farmland) were field-tested on the Pb/Zn mine tailings. There was no significant difference in seedling density among the 4 thickness treatments. Many seeds in the treatments with more than 1-cm of topsoil were unable to emerge from the deeper layer. Seedlings in plots with topsoil of 1-, 2- and 4-cm failed to establish within 1 year due to the extremely high acidity (pH 2.39 to 2.76). A shallow layer of topsoil cannot neutralize the sulfuric acid generated from oxidation of pyrites in the tailings. For establishment of seedlings on metalliferous lands, an insulating layer such as subsoil, building rubble, or domestic refuse is necessary before covering with valuable topsoil. The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala grown on the tailings with a topsoil cover of 8-cm was the most dominant species. Lead was accumulated in root, branch, stem bark, and xylem, which accounted for more than 80% of the total metal concentration in the plant. This portion of Pb will reside in the plant for a long period, while the smaller portion of Pb in the leaf (about 15%) could be returned to the environment as litter during growth. Woody plants may have an advantage in metalphyto-remediation over herbaceous plants.","Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Inst Nat Resources & Environm Management, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Biol, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Zhongshan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China","Wong, MH (reprint author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Inst Nat Resources & Environm Management, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,27,50,63,1,15,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

The aims of this paper were (1) finding an appropriate clamping procedure for root measurements: and (2) studying the effect of elongation rate on stress-strain relationships of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) roots. It was found that problems associated with root clamping (i.e., in root experiments) such as breakage of the root sample close to the jaws of the clamping devices and slippage may be eliminated by introducing wooden blocks of appropriate hardness within the jaws of the clamps and exerting a suitable clamping force, respectively. An appropriate wood hardness and suitable clamping force were found by conducting a number of initial trial experiments. Tensile experiments conducted with beech roots pairs showed that elongation rate does influence the stress-strain relationships of roots. In general, stress values of beech roots were found to increase between 8 and 20% for an increase in the rate of elongation from 10 to 400 mm/min. Similar findings have been reported in textile fibres. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we compare two models representing contrasting degrees of abstraction of the processes governing dynamics in real vegetation. 2 Model (a) (GUESS) simulates explicitly growth and competition among individual plants. Differences in crown structure (height, depth, area and LAI) influence relative light uptake by neighbours. Assimilated carbon is allocated individually by each plant to its leaf, fine root and sapwood tissues. Carbon allocation and turnover of sapwood to heartwood in turn govern height and diameter growth. 3 Model (b) (LPJ) incorporates a 'dynamic global vegetation model' (DGVM) architecture, simulating growth of populations of plant functional types (PFTs) over a grid cell, integrating individual-level processes over the proportional area (foliar projective cover, FPC) occupied by each PFT. Individual plants are not simulated, but are replaced by explicit parameterizations of their growth and interactions. 4 The models are identical in their representation of core physiological and biogeochemical processes. Both also use the same set of PFTs, corresponding to the major woody plant groups in Europe, plus a grass type. 5 When applied at a range of locations, broadly spanning climatic variation within Europe, both models successfully predicted PFT composition and succession within modern natural vegetation. However, the individual-based model performed better in areas where deciduous and evergreen types coincide, and in areas subject to pronounced seasonal water deficits, which would tend to favour grasses over drought-intolerant trees. 6 Differences in model performance could be traced to their treatment of individual-level processes, in particular light competition and stress-induced mortality. 7 Our results suggest that an explicit individual-based approach to vegetation dynamics may be an advantage in modelling of ecosystem structure and function at the resolution required for regional-to continental-scale studies.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Climate Impacts Grp, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany","Smith, B (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Climate Impacts Grp, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",,"Smith, Benjamin/I-1212-2016","Smith, Benjamin/0000-0002-6987-5337",,,,40,505,537,6,169,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-7447,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Rhizosphere samples were collected from different root regions (root tips, the root base, and the intermediate region where lateral roots emerge) and developmental stages (the seedling, vegetative, and generative stage) from plants cultivated on reused rockwool. By colony counts on 1/10 strength TSA on subsequent days after plating, percentages of fast- and slow-growing isolates (i.e., forming visible colonies within 2 days, or after 3 or more days, respectively) were determined for each rhizosphere sample, At all plant developmental stages, root Lips had the highest percentages of fast growing isolates, and root bases the lowest. During plant growth, the relative amounts of slowly growing bacteria increased. Community-level carbon source utilization was determined for the different rhizosphere samples with Biolog GN plates. Principal component analysis showed that rhizosphere samples from different developmental stages and root locations had distinct carbon source utilization patterns. Communities from root tips of seedlings showed the highest utilization of several monosaccharides. Communities from tips and intermediate regions of plants in the vegetative stage utilized relatively many amino acids and several organic acids, and in the generative stage, more di- and polysaccharides were used. Root base samples scored low with respect to carbon source utilization, except for some disaccharides. From the different rhizosphere samples, 826 bacteria, randomly collected from 1/10 strength TSA plates, were screened on the utilization of 9 carbon sources. The 9 selected carbon sources were chosen because they are reported to occur in the rhizosphere, to be used by the zoospores of Pythium in the infection process, or appeared to be discriminant in the analysis of community-level carbon source utilization performed in this study. It appeared that monosaccharides (glucose and fucose), amino acids (alanine and asparagine), and organic acids (galacturonic, succinic, and linoleic acid) were used for growth mainly by bacteria from the root tips, and to a lesser extent from the intermediate region, of young plants. Disaccharides were predominantly utilized by isolates from plants in the vegetative stage. Overall, the results indicated that growth rates and carbon source utilization reflect the adaptation of bacteria to the rhizosphere environment. The possibility of using these characteristics to screen for rhizosphere competent biocontrol agents that compete for substrates with P. aphanidermatum is discussed.","Plant Res Int, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; Leiden Univ, Inst Evolutionary & Ecol Sci, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","Postma, J (reprint author), Plant Res Int, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",J.Postma@plant.wag-ur.nl,"van Veen, Johannes A/C-3697-2011; postma, Joeke/E-8803-2011",,,,,56,28,32,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

The phylogeny of the largest presently accepted genus, Glomus, of the monogeneric family Glomaceae (Glomales; AM fungi) was analyzed. Phylogenetic trees were computed from nearly full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences of 30 isolates, and show that ""Glomus"" is not monophyletic. Even after the very recent separation of Archaeospora and Paraglomus from ""Glomus,"" the genus further separates into two suprageneric clades. One of them diverges further into two subclades, differing by phylogenetic distances equivalent to family level. The other, comprising Glomus versiforme, G. spurcum and a species morphologically similar to G. etunicatum, is not closely related to the Glomaceae, but clusters together with the Acaulosporaceae and Gigasporaceae in a monophyletic clade. Based on the molecular evidence, a new family, separate from the Glomaceae, is required to accommodate this group of organisms, initially named Diversisporaceae fam. ined. The current taxonomic concept of the recently erected family Archaeosporaceae also requires future emendation, because Geosiphon pyriformis (Geosiphonaceae) renders Archaeospora, the sole genus formally included in this family, paraphyletic. The suborders Gigasporineae and Glominaeae are not congruent with the natural phylogeny of the AM fungi. Our data necessitate a general reexamination of the generic concepts within the Glomales. In addition to the new family structure hypothesized herein, establishment of at least three new genera will be necessary in the future.

We find that the carbon making up the standing stock of fine roots in deciduous and coniferous forests of the eastern United States has a mean age of 3-18 years for live fine roots, 10-18 years for dead fine roots, and 3-18 years for mixed live+dead fine roots. These C-14-derived mean ages represent the time C was stored in the plant before being allocated for root growth, plus the average lifespan (for live roots), plus the average time for the root to decompose (for dead roots and mixtures). Comparison of the C-14 content of roots known to have grown within I year with the C-14 of atmospheric CO2 for the same period shows that root tissues are derived from recently fixed carbon, and the storage time prior to allocation is <2 years and likely <1 year. Fine-root mean ages tend to increase with depth in the soil. Live roots in the organic horizons are made of C fixed 3-8 years ago compared with 11-18 years in the mineral B horizons. The mean age of C in roots increases with root diameter and also is related to branching order. Our results differ dramatically from previous estimates of fine-root mean ages made using mass balance approaches and root-viewing cameras, which generally report life spans (mean ages for live roots) of a few months to 1-2 years. Each method for estimating fine-root dynamics, including this new radiocarbon method, has biases. Root-viewing approaches tend to emphasize more rapidly cycling roots, while radiocarbon ages tend to reflect those components that persist longest in the soil. Our C-14-derived estimates of long mean ages can be reconciled with faster estimates only if fine-root populations have varying rates of root mortality and decomposition. Our results indicate that it standard definition of fine roots, as those with diameters of <2 mm, is inadequate to determine the most dynamic portion of the root population. Recognition of the variability in fine-root dynamics is necessary to obtain better estimates of belowground C inputs.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; Woods Hole Res Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Gaudinski, JB (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92612 USA.",,"Trumbore, Susan/B-1948-2013; Davidson, Eric A/K-4984-2013","Davidson, Eric A/0000-0002-8525-8697",,,,41,181,203,0,56,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2001,129,3,,,,,420,429,,10.1007/s004420100746,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,496VQ,WOS:000172418100012,28547197,,,,10/31/19J,"Wright, SF; Jawson, L",,,,"Wright, SF; Jawson, L",,,A pressure cooker method to extract glomalin from soils,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; AGGREGATE STABILITY; PROTEIN; HYPHAE,"Glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, is an important constituent of soil organic matter.

Most soil-testing laboratories have access to all of the instruments required for glomalin analysis except an autoclave. Small (4-L) and large (14-L) pressure cookers were compared with a bench-top autoclave to test glomalin extraction from three soils using 50 mM citrate, pH 8.0 as the extracting agent. Glomalin concentrations, as measured by the Bradford protein assay, were identical for extracts from the autoclave and the 14-L pressure cooker when 103 kPa (121 degreesC) was achieved in both vessels.

This paper presents a conceptual decision model to predict inoculation success in a landscape context. A brief review is given of the potential benefits of inoculation and possible limitations. Several approaches are considered: a plant physiological model based on plant-fungus carbon economy; an economic approach which balances increased yield against increased management costs, and a combined economic-physiological model. This latter model considers site factors, plant performance and likelihood of mycorrhizal benefits, combined with economic values and subjective utilities. The proposed model offers a framework for the interpretation and application of research findings as these become available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

West Virginia northern flying squirrels facilitate spore dispersal of these mycorrhizal fungi and may contribute to the health of tree species in high elevation red spruce (Picea rubens)/northern hardwood forests in West Virginia.","WVDNR Nongame Wildlife & Nat Heritage Program, Elkins, WV 26241 USA","Mitchell, D (reprint author), WVDNR Nongame Wildlife & Nat Heritage Program, Ware Rd,POB 67, Elkins, WV 26241 USA.",,,,,,,23,19,20,0,13,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The mycorrhizal growth response differed between developmental stages of the host plant and various substrates. Older nurse plants in central compartments of rhizoboxes (separated by a nylon mesh from two lateral compartments) showed different growth response to inoculation with AMF in comparison with seedlings transplanted into lateral rhizobox compartments 3 months later, after the establishment of the network of extraradical mycelium (ERM). Nurse plants cultivated in industrial substrates and in the control substrate sand showed neutral or negative response to AMF inoculation. The seedlings showed neutral or positive effects of inoculation when grown in industrial substrates, while in the sand the response was negative for all AMF isolates. The disturbance of ERM links between the central and lateral compartments delayed significantly mycorrhizal colonisation of seedlings; however, a negligible effect of ERM disturbance on the growth of seedlings was found. No differences in the development of native and non-native AMF isolates in the industrial substrates were found except for Glomus mosseae BEG99 from Brezno spoil bank growing better in the native substrate as compared to the non-native isolate G. mosseae BEG25. Mycorrhizal colonisation initiated from an established ERM network radiating from the nurse plant supported early developmental stages of C. epigejos in industrial substrates. However, the disturbance of ERM links between nurse plants and seedlings had no effect on the growth of seedlings, which did not support the hypothesis about the role of ERM links in intraspecific interactions between differently aged grass plants.

Variation in clonal reproduction has previously been explained by variation in effects of abiotic resource heterogeneity and by plant genotypic variation. Different co-occurring species of the mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to differentially alter growth traits of Prunella vulgaris, which we hypothesize would lead to changes in clonal reproduction. Two experiments were carried out to test whether different co-occurring mycorrhizal fungi significantly influence clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris, whether this effect also occurs when P. vulgaris is growing in an artificial plant community, and how the effects compare with plant genotype effects on clonal growth of P. vulgaris. In the first experiment, the number of ramets of P. vulgaris, growing in a plant community of simulated calcareous grassland, was significantly affected by inoculation with different mycorrhizal fungi. The number of ramets produced by P. vulgaris differed by a factor of up to 1.8 with different mycorrhizal fungi. The fungal effects on the number of new ramets were independent of their effects on the biomass of P. vulgaris. In a second experiment, 17 different genotypes of P. vulgaris were inoculated with different mycorrhizal fungi. There were significant main effects of genotypes and mycorrhizal fungi on clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris. The effect of different mycorrhizal fungi contributed more than the effect of plant genotype to variation in size and ramet production. However, mean stolon length and spacer length, which determine the spatial arrangement of ramets, were only significantly affected by plant genotype. There were no mycorrhizal fungal X plant genotype interactions on clonal growth of P. vulgaris indicating that there is no obvious evidence that selection pressures would favor further coevolution between P. vulgaris and mycorrhizal fungal species. In natural communities plants can be colonized by several different AMF at the same time. The effect of the mixed AMF treatment on the growth and clonal reproduction of P. vulgaris could not be predicted from the responses of the plants to the single AMF To what extent, however, the patterns of colonization by different AMF differ among plants in a natural community is unknown. Since the effects of AMF on growth and clonal reproduction occur on a population of P. vulgaris in a microcosm plant community and because the effects are also as great as those caused by plant genotypic variation, we conclude that the effects are strong enough to potentially affect population size and variation of clonal plants in communities.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Abt Pflanzenphysiol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Ecol, Biol Bldg, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"van der Heijden, Marcel G.A./H-5243-2011; Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",,,,60,55,62,2,35,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2001,82,10,,,,,2846,2859,,,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,487FN,WOS:000171863100014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dauber, J; Schroeter, D; Wolters, V",,,,"Dauber, J; Schroeter, D; Wolters, V",,,Species specific effects of ants on microbial activity and N-availability in the soil of an old-field,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,13th International Colloquium on Soil Zoology (ICSZ),"AUG 14-18, 2000","CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,ant mounds; ecosystem engineers; Formicidae; microbial activity; microbial biomass,BIOMASS,"Microbial biomass and activity as well as N-availability were measured in the mounds of three ant species strongly differing in foraging strategy and mound architecture: Myrmica scabrinodis, Lasius niger and L. flavus. Soil microbial biomass (C-mic) was significantly increased in the mounds of all three ant species. This positive effect was due to the accumulation of organic matter (C-org) within the mounds. Microbial activity was increased in M. scabrinodis mounds only. Available N-min was accumulated in all mound types, independent of the feeding mode of the ants, with Lasius mounds having significantly higher N-min content than M. scabrinodis mounds. It is hypothesised that the differences between the mound types are due to differences in nest architecture, especially the integration of grassy vegetation. Higher microbial activity in M. scabrinodis mounds may be a consequence of supplementary energy provided by root exudates. The amount of N-min in M. scabrinodis mounds may be reduced by increased plant uptake and by immobilisation within the microbial biomass.

In addition, the association of fine root pathogens of the genera Phytophthora and Pythium with the trees' rhizosphere was studied. In a variety of stands representnig various site conditions, soil and root samples were taken from 12 spruce (Picea abies) pairs and, eight beech (Fagus sylvatica) pairs. Each pair consisted of a healthy and a declining tree as indicated by crown transparency. The root status was characterized using a set of parameters, and correlations between crown and fine root status were observed. In spruce, most parameters decreased significantly, with increasing crown transparency, whereas in beech, correlations were less pronounced. The total number of lateral roots per cm small root (diameter 2-5 mm) was significantly, lower in both species for declining trees compared to healthy trees. Pythium spp. were isolated from 15 of 24 soil samples taken from under spruce, and from eight of 16 samples from under beech. Phytophthora citricola was found in two beech stands only. Among the isolated species, Pythium anandrum, Pythium inflatum and Pythium acrogynum were identified according to morphological features. After polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, residual Pythium isolates were assigned to four different groups. No crown transparency-dependent differences in isolation frequency were found. In soil infestation tests, all species tested caused root damage on both young spruce and beech plants, with P. citricola being the most aggressive pathogen. Additionally, Pythium-infected beeches showed severe leaf chloroses and necroses. Due to their low isolation frequency, Phytophthora spp. are not considered to play a major role in the decline of spruce and beech in the investigated area. Pythium spp., however, were isolated frequently, showed pathogenicity towards the fine roots of spruce and beech, and are therefore considered to be at least contributing factors in the decline of Bavarian mountain forests.","Tech Univ Munich, Sect Phytopathol, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Nechwatal, J (reprint author), Tech Univ Munich, Sect Phytopathol, Hochanger 13, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",,,,,,,59,30,30,0,10,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",1437-4781,,,FOREST PATHOL,Forest Pathol.,OCT,2001,31,5,,,,,257,273,,10.1046/j.1439-0329.2001.00244.x,,,17,Forestry,Forestry,480UK,WOS:000171481000001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pritchard, SG; Rogers, HH; Davis, MA; Van Santen, E; Prior, SA; Schlesinger, WH",,,,"Pritchard, SG; Rogers, HH; Davis, MA; Van Santen, E; Prior, SA; Schlesinger, WH",,,The influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 on fine root dynamics in an intact temperate forest,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated CO2; Pinus taeda; root production; root turnover; root length; FACE,GLOBAL CHANGE; ENRICHMENT; RESPONSES; TURNOVER; RHIZOSPHERE; GROWTH; GRASSLANDS; AMBIENT,"Root dynamics are important for plant, ecosystem and global carbon cycling. Changes in root dynamics caused by rising atmospheric CO2 not only have the potential to moderate further CO2 increases, but will likely affect forest function. We used FACE (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment) to expose three 30-m diameter plots in a 13-year-old loblolly pine (Pines taeda) forest to elevated (ambient +200 muL L-1) atmospheric CO2. Three identical fully instrumented plots were implemented as controls (ambient air only). We quantified root dynamics from October 1998 to October 1999 using minirhizotrons. In spite of 16% greater root lengths and 24% more roots per minirhizotron tube, the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on root lengths and numbers were not statistically significant. Similarly, production and mortality were also unaffected by the CO2 treatment, even though annual root production and mortality were 26% and 46% greater in elevated compared to ambient CO2 plots. Average diameters of live roots present at the shallowest soil depth were, however, significantly enhanced in CO2-enriched plots. Mortality decreased with increasing soil depth and the slopes of linear regression lines (mortality vs. depth) differed between elevated and ambient CO2 treatments, reflecting the significant CO2 by depth interaction. Relative root turnover (root flux/live root pool) was unchanged by exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2. Results from this study suggest modest, if any, increases in ecosystem-level root productivity in CO2-enriched environments.","ARS, USDA, Wind Eros & Water Conservat Res Unit, Big Spring, TX 79720 USA; ARS, USDA, Natl Soil Dynam Lab, Auburn, AL 36832 USA; Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; Auburn Univ, Dept Agron & Soils, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Pritchard, SG (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Wind Eros & Water Conservat Res Unit, 302 W I-20, Big Spring, TX 79720 USA.",,,"Prior, Stephen Arthur/0000-0003-1750-6326",,,,33,31,39,3,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Solidago shortii grows in a variety of habitats, but primarily in rocky/shallow soil areas, and S. altissima occurs in adjacent old fields/pastures. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the biology of these two species that might contribute to an explanation for differences in their geographical distribution and habitat. Methods Results of an extensive literature review and of original research by the authors were used in a detailed comparison of the two species. The most ecologically relevant aspects of the biology investigated were morphology, genetics, geography, life cycle, life history, reproductive biology, physiology, biotic interactions and response to disturbance. Results Although S. shortii and S. altissima are quite similar in many aspects of their biology, there are some important differences. Solidago altissima is a better competitor than S. shortii via its greater height, larger leaf area and more extensive clonal growth. On the other hand, S. shortii is a better drought-stress tolerator than S. altissima via allocation of a higher percentage of biomass to roots, higher root/shoot ratio and (seemingly) greater capacity to maintain leaf turgor (i.e. not wilt as readily) under xeric conditions. Moreover, higher seed production in S. altissima and its capacity to form a larger- and longer-lived soil seed bank than S. shortii probably contribute to differences in colonization abilities. Landscape disturbances and metapopulation dynamics are important factors in maintenance of the species population of S. shortii, and in prevention of its extinction. Main conclusions Solidago shortii probably is a relatively young species that as had insufficient time to expand its range. Furthermore, it is not well suited for migration to, or colonization of, habitats outside its range due to poor competitive and colonization abilities.","Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; Univ Kentucky, Sch Biol Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Univ Kentucky, Dept Agron, Lexington, KY 40546 USA","Walck, JL (reprint author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 60, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",,,,,,,201,40,49,2,40,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We established systems with or without wood ash amendment (first-order disturbance) in the soil, either in the presence or absence of C. sphagnetorum. To test whether the systems treated with wood ash are more sensitive to an additional disturbance than the ash-free systems, the microcosms were later on disturbed by drought. To determine the influence of two disturbances on the enchytraeids and populations of other fauna, and the possible changes in the system functioning, measurements were made of the growth of birch seedlings, foliar N concentration, composition and biomass of soil microbial communities and leaching of N and dissolved organic carbon from the microcosms. Both wood ash application and drought exerted a clear negative influence on the populations of C. sphagnetorum. However, populations of this species were very resilient and recovered rapidly after drought in the ash-free soils. In the ash-free soils C. sphagnetorum tended to improve birch growth, increased the N content of the birch leaves, and decreased the root to shoot ratio. However, in the ash-treated soils enchytraeids had negative effects on these parameters. C. sphagnetorum impacted on neither N and C leaching nor soil microbes, whereas wood ash decreased microbial biomasses and changed their community structure (as determined by phospholipid fatty acids method and denaturing gel electrophoresis) and substrate utilisation potential (Biolog method). It was concluded that C. sphagnetorum can retain its influential role under varying environmental conditions, but that the stimulating or retarding effects of this species on system functioning can be context dependent.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Det Biol & Environm Sci, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa 01301, Finland","Liiri, M (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Det Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,"Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015",,,,,66,21,21,1,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The two rates of sewage amendment corresponded to 11.2 t ha(-1) and 22.4 t ha-1 and were calculated on the basis of the sewage phosphorus content and the amount of phosphorus recommended for soybean fertilization. Results were evaluated 49 and 63 days after plant emergence. Nodule number and weight decreased as follows: IS+P > IS+SSI, IS+SS2 > IS-P No nodules were formed without inoculation. The acetylene reduction activity was highest for the IS+P treatment 49 days after plant emergence. At the 63-day harvest that parameter was similar among IS+P, IS+SS1 and IS+SS2 treatments. The total amounts of nitrogen in shoots were similar for IS+P, IS+SS1 and IS+SS2 treatments at the first harvest but by 63 days after plant emergence, total amounts of nitrogen in above-ground parts (shoot and pods) were higher in IS+P and IS+SS2. This was due to higher pod dry weights. This study demonstrated that soybean growth can be improved by sewage sludge at a low application rate without the necessity of additional phosphorus fertilization.","Embrapa Meio Ambiente, BR-13820000 Sao Paulo, Brazil","Vieira, RF (reprint author), Embrapa Meio Ambiente, BR-13820000 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,,,,,,23,22,24,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

Our analysis shows that it is important to separate the physical factors affecting access to carbon (C), i.e., decomposer colonization rate, from the chemical characteristics of litter in decomposition models. Soil C stores predicted with models based on the colonization rate of decomposers are much less sensitive to the shape and size of coarse woody litter than predictions based on the two other approaches. The effect of temperature on steady-state soil C storage is greater for litter that is colonized rapidly than for litter that is colonized slowly. The decomposition of litter types like needles, fine roots, and field-layer vegetation is therefore more sensitive to temperature changes than the decomposition of stems and coarse roots, and this difference is more pronounced at high temperatures than at low temperatures.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Hyvonen, R (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Res, POB 7072, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,18,42,42,0,9,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We conducted an experiment to study the effects of defoliation and soil fungi on interactions between Centaurea melitensis, an invasive annual from Eurasia, and Nassella pulchra, a native Californian bunchgrass. Defoliation of C. melitensis reduced its final biomass in all species-fungicide treatments, except when C. melitensis was grown with both Nassella and non-treated soil fungi at the same time. In this treatment, the biomass of clipped C. melitensis plants was equal to that of unclipped plants, indicating that soil fungi and Nassella promoted a compensatory response in the weed. Overall, the biomass of C melitensis was 44% lower when soil fungi were reduced. However, in soil not treated with fungicide, the total biomass of C melitensis increased in the presence of Nassella, but decreased when it was grown alone. When stressed by defoliation, C. melitensis may benefit from a form of mycorrhizae-mediated parasitism through a common mycorrhizal network, or Nassella may alter the fungal community in a way that enhances the positive direct effects of soil fungi on Centaurea.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",callaway@selway.umt.edu,,,,,,33,70,81,3,56,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

The effects of defoliation on tree physiology are expected to cascade through the entire forest ecosystem, altering carbon, nitrogen, and water fluxes, and subsequently affecting nitrogen cycling and plant-herbivore interactions. If these post-defoliation changes are largely driven by, N deficiency, tree root system responses to defoliation should be central to regulating the long-term effects of defoliation; N fertilization should reverse the effects. We examined these phenomena in a 3-year large-scale replicated manipulative field experiment in a hybrid poplar plantation, where we regulated defoliation by gypsy moths as well as nitrogen availability. To our knowledge, this is the first manipulative field experiment at this scale to examine the effects of severe insect defoliation on whole-tree physiology. Defoliation decreased tree growth and increased the rate of top dieback in the stand. Defoliation led to transient declines in carbon allocation to starch in fine roots, trunk, and twigs in the year of heaviest defoliation. Root production and root mortality were unaffected by the heaviest defoliation, but nitrate and ammonium uptake were strongly depressed. N fertilization increased tree growth, but did not alter defoliation effects on starch accumulation or top dieback. Defoliation and fertilization treatments did not interact. In this system, defoliation effects on tree recovery of leaf nitrogen lost to herbivory were primarily driven by effects on nitrogen uptake, rather than effects on root production or mortality.","Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Kosola, KR (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",kosola@kbs.msu.edu,"Kosola, Kevin/R-3724-2019","Boutjdir, Mohamed/0000-0002-6068-223X",,,,53,106,118,6,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2001,129,1,,,,,65,74,,10.1007/s004420100694,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,478CN,WOS:000171325500007,28547069,,,,10/31/19J,"Leriche, H; LeRoux, X; Gignoux, J; Tuzet, A; Fritz, H; Abbadie, L; Loreau, M",,,,"Leriche, H; LeRoux, X; Gignoux, J; Tuzet, A; Fritz, H; Abbadie, L; Loreau, M",,,Which functional processes control the short-term effect of grazing on net primary production in grasslands?,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,herbivory; nitrogen; overcompensation; root/shoot allocation; soil moisture,YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE; HERBIVORE-OPTIMIZATION; HUMID SAVANNA; WATER-STRESS; SALT-MARSH; DEFOLIATION; RESPONSES; PLANTS; GROWTH,"Grazing has traditionally been viewed as detrimental to plant growth, but it has been proposed that under certain conditions, grazing may lead to compensatory or overcompensatory growth. However, comprehensive information on the relative role of the main functional processes controlling the response of net primary production (NPP) to grazing is still lacking. In this study, a modelling approach was used to quantify the relative importance of key functional processes in the response of annual canopy NPP to grazing for a West African humid grassland. The PEPSEE-grass model, which represents radiation absorption, NPP, water balance and carbon allocation, was used to compute total and aboveground NPP in response to grazing pressure. Representations of grazing and mineral nitrogen input to the canopy were simplified to focus on the vegetation processes implemented and their relative importance. Simulations were performed using a constant or resource-driven root/shoot allocation coefficient, and dependence or independence of conversion efficiency of absorbed light into dry matter on nitrogen availability. There were three main results. Firstly, the response of NPP to grazing intensity emerged as a complex result of both positive and negative, and direct and indirect effects of biomass removal on light absorption efficiency, soil water availability, grass nitrogen status and productivity, and root/shoot allocation pattern. Secondly, overcompensation was observed for aboveground NPP when assuming a nitrogen-dependent conversion efficiency and a resource-driven root/shoot allocation. Thirdly, the response of NPP to grazing was mainly controlled by the effect of plant nitrogen status on conversion efficiency and by the root/shoot allocation pattern, while the effects of improved water status and reduced light absorption were secondary.","CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol ENS, F-75005 Paris, France; Univ Clermont Ferrand, INRA, PIAF, UA Bioclimatol, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand 02, France; CEBC, CNRS, F-79360 Beauvoir S Niort, France; INRA, Unite Bioclimatol, F-78000 Thiverval Grignon, France","Leriche, H (reprint author), CNRS, UMR 7625, Lab Ecol ENS, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",eleriche@biologie.ens.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",,,,73,70,76,1,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2001,129,1,,,,,114,124,,10.1007/s004420100697,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,478CN,WOS:000171325500012,28547058,,,,10/31/19J,"Miller, AI; Connolly, SR",,,,"Miller, AI; Connolly, SR",,,Substrate affinities of higher taxa and the Ordovician Radiation,PALEOBIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; UNITED-STATES; MARINE LIFE; MIDDLE; PATTERNS; EXAMPLES,"The Ordovician Radiation exhibited a global transition in dominance from the Cambrian evolutionary fauna (e.g., trilobites), to the Paleozoic and Modern faunas (e.g.,articulate brachiopods and bivalve molluscs). Although its causes have yet to be determined definitively, the transition coincided with increased global tectonism. Erosion of source areas uplifted during orogenic activity increased the siliciclastic richness of marine substrates in many venues, and it has been hypothesized previously that higher taxa with affinities for siliciclastics diversified in association with these environmental changes, whereas higher taxa not exhibiting such affinities either failed to radiate or declined in diversity. Here, we provide an initial test of this substrate affinity hypothesis by evaluating the Ordovician affinities of trilobites and articulate brachiopods. Our analyses - at the class level for both trilobites and articulate brachiopods, and at the order level for orthid and strophomenid brachiopods - were based on the affinities of constituent genera for siliciclastic, carbonate, and mixed siliciclastic/carbonate settings. Individual genus affinities are calculated with a database of genus occurrences encompassing nine Ordovician paleocontinents. Using these values, we developed a standardized relative affinity (SRA) metric to compare the propensities of higher taxa, and to assess changes in relative affinities of individual higher taxa from series to series. A simple comparison of trilobites and articulate brachiopods for the Ordovician in aggregate does not appear to support the substrate affinity hypothesis: articulate brachiopods, which contributed increasingly to overall diversity through the period, exhibit in overall affinity for carbonates and an aversion to siliciclastics. However, a rather different view emerges when we Consider the affinity trajectories of higher taxa through the period: articulate brachiopods exhibit a growing affinity for siliciclastics and a declining affinity for carbonates, whereas the Opposite is the case among trilobites. Among constituent articulate brachiopod orders, the affinity trajectories of orthids and strophomenids mirror that of the class. Thus, the increasing dominance of articulate brachiopods in the Middle and Late Ordovician may have been linked to the affinity for siliciclastics of a diversifying subset of the group, but further investigation will be required to verify this claim.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Miller, AI (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, POB 210013, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",,"Connolly, Sean R./E-7773-2011","Connolly, Sean R./0000-0003-1537-0859",,,,28,32,35,0,4,PALEONTOLOGICAL SOC INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0094-8373,,,PALEOBIOLOGY,Paleobiology,FAL,2001,27,4,,,,,768,778,,10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027<0768:SAOHTA>2.0.CO;2,,,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology,512CM,WOS:000173303600011,,,,,10/31/19J,"Zou, C; Penfold, C; Sands, R; Misra, RK; Hudson, I",,,,"Zou, C; Penfold, C; Sands, R; Misra, RK; Hudson, I",,,"Effects of soil air-filled porosity, soil matric potential and soil strength on primary root growth of radiata pine seedlings",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,air-filled porosity; Pinus radiata; root elongation; soil matric potential; soil strength,FOREST SOILS; COMPACTION; PENETROMETER,"The effects of soil air-filled porosity, soil matric potential and soil strength on primary root growth of radiata pine ( Pinus radiata D.

At low penetrometer resistance (< 0.5 MPa) and high soil matric potential (greater than or equal to - 0.01 MPa), root elongation rate was close to zero when air-filled porosity was < 0.05 m(3) m(-)3, and it increased sharply to 90% of its maximum value at 0.15 m(3)m(-3). This relationship was independent of soil texture. The diameter of the root tip increased as air-filled porosity decreased, particularly below 0.10 m(3) m(-3). Root elongation rate decreased linearly with decreasing soil matric potential over the range - 0.01 to -0.35 MPa at both 0.5 MPa and 1.5 MPa soil strength. This relationship was independent of soil texture. The rate of root elongation at 0.5 MPa was about twice that at 1.5 MPa and the rate of decrease in root elongation with decreasing soil matric potential was 1.35 times greater at the lower (0.5 MPa) than the higher (1.5 MPa) soil strength. The effect of water potential (over the range -0.01 to -1.5 MPa) on root elongation at zero soil strength was simulated using PEG 4000 solutions as rooting media. Root elongation declined exponentially over the range of water potentials established in the rooting medium. Root elongation rate decreased exponentially with increasing soil strength when soil matric potential was constant and air-filled porosity was > 0.20 m(3) m(-3). This relationship was independent of soil texture. Root elongation rate was half its maximum at a penetrometer resistance of 1.3 MPa. Increasing bulk density has a greater effect of increasing soil strength in coarse soil than in fine soil but decreasing soil water content has a greater effect on increasing soil strength in fine soil than in coarse soil.","Univ Canterbury, Sch Forestry, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci, Maroochydore DC, Qld 4558, Australia; Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand","Zou, C (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecol & Management, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,"Misra, Rabindra K/B-2003-2012; Zou, Chris/A-5039-2010","Zou, Chris/0000-0003-0080-2866; Hudson, Irene/0000-0002-9000-9556",,,,29,52,62,0,19,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,2001,236,1,,,,,105,115,,10.1023/A:1011994615014,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,477RY,WOS:000171299100010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Marschner, P; Yang, CH; Lieberei, R; Crowley, DE",,,,"Marschner, P; Yang, CH; Lieberei, R; Crowley, DE",,,Soil and plant specific effects on bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,rhizosphere; soil type; plant species; eubacterial community composition; DGGE,GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; ESTER FAME PROFILES; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ROOT EXUDATION; DIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; DYNAMICS; CARBON,"Eubacterial community structures in the plant rhizosphere were examined with respect to plant species, soil type, and root zone location. Three plant species (chickpea, rape and Sudan grass) were grown in intact cores of three California soils (a sandy soil, a sandy loam, and a clay) and were provided with a complete fertilizer solution with or without nitrogen supplied as ammonium nitrate. After 7.5 weeks, the plants were harvested and DNA was extracted from soil adhering to the root tips and from mature root zones at the sites of lateral root emergence. Eubacterial community structures were examined by PCR-DGGE of 16S rDNA to determine the relative abundance and species diversity. While both soil type and nitrogen fertilization affected plant growth, canonical correspondence analyses showed that nitrogen had no significant effect on eubacterial community structures. Eubacterial species diversity was higher in the mature root zones than at the root tips in the sandy soil and the clay but not in the loamy sand. Monte Carlo permutation tests indicated that plant species, root zone and soil type as well as the interactions between these variables had significant effects on community structure. The bacterial rhizosphere community of chickpea was influenced primarily by soil type, whereas root zone was less important. In contrast to chickpea, the community in the rhizosphere of rape and Sudan grass was more affected by the root zone than the soil type. In the sandy soil and the loamy sand, the eubacterial rhizosphere community structure was more affected by the root zone than the plant species and the three plant species had distinct communities. In the clay however, the root zone was less important than the plant species and the rhizosphere communities of chickpea differed from those of rape and Sudan grass. It is concluded that the bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere is affected by a complex interaction between soil type, plant species and root zone location.

In most studies, bulk soil samples are collected to determine isotope abundance. Such sampling overlooks the potential impact of preferential flow on isotope distribution. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of preferential flow on the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, delta C-13, and delta N-15 in a forest soil in Central Switzerland. Preferential flow paths in the soil were identified with a dye tracer, Brilliant Blue (Pluss-Staufer AG, Oftringen, Switzerland), that was homogeneously applied to the soil surface. In the stained preferential flow paths, concentrations of SOC and total N were 15 to 75% higher than in the soil matrix. The total increase of SOC in preferential flow paths ranged from 740 to 960 g C m(-2) in four individual soil plots. Values of delta C-13 and WIN were lowest in tree leaves and in the forest floor, and increased with soil depth, thus with the degree of decomposition of SOC. In the mineral soil, preferential flow paths were significantly depleted in C-13 by 0.15 to 0.4 parts per thousand as compared with the soil matrix. The delta N-15 values increased with soil depth from 0.9 to 4.7 parts per thousand in the preferential flow paths and from 0.5 to 6 parts per thousand in the soil matrix. Adding a highly enriched N-15-tracer homogeneously to the soil surface showed a higher recovery of N-15 in the soil and in the fine roots sampled from preferential flow paths than in those sampled from the soil matrix. Our results suggest that in preferential flow paths, SOC is younger and N cycling is more rapid than in the soil matrix.","Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Bundt, M (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",,"Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009","Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776",,,,44,52,56,3,47,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Franco (Douglas-fir) seedlings were grown in a 2 x 2 factorial design in enclosed mesocosms at ambient temperature or 3.5 degreesC above ambient, and at ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2]) or 179 ppm above ambient. Two additional mesocosms were maintained as open controls. We measured the extent of mycorrhizal infection, foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations on both a weight basis (%N) and area basis (Narea), and foliar delta N-15 signatures (N-15/N-14 ratios) from summer 1993 through summer 1997. Mycorrhizal fungi had colonized nearly all root tips across all treatments by spring 1994. Elevated [CO2] lowered foliar %N but did not affect N-area, whereas elevated temperature increased both foliar %N and Nar, Foliar delta N-15 was initially -1 parts per thousand and dropped by the final harvest to between -4 and -5 parts per thousand in the enclosed mesocosms, probably because of transfer of isotopically depleted N from mycorrhizal. fungi. Based on the similarity in foliar delta N-15 among treatments, we conclude that mycorrhizal fungi had similar N allocation patterns across CO2 and temperature treatments. We combined isotopic and N-area data for 1993-94 to calculate fluxes of N for second- and third-year needles. Yearly N influxes were higher in second-year needles than in third-year needles (about 160 and 50% of initial leaf N, respectively), indicating greater sink strength in the younger needles. Influxes of N in second-year needles increased in response to elevated temperature, suggesting increased N supply from soil relative to plant N demands. In the elevated temperature treatments, N effluxes from third-year needles were higher in seedlings in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2], probably because of increased N allocation below ground. We conclude that N allocation patterns shifted in response to the elevated temperature and [CO2] treatments in the seedlings but not in their fungal symbionts.","US EPA, Natl Res Council, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Hobbie, EA (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Postfach 10 01 64, D-07701 Jena, Germany.",,,,,,,32,35,37,0,18,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,SEP,2001,21,15,,,,,1113,1122,,10.1093/treephys/21.15.1113,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,478QF,WOS:000171356300003,11581018,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Zegzouti, R; Arnould, MF; Favre, JM",,,,"Zegzouti, R; Arnould, MF; Favre, JM",,,Histological investigation of the multiplication step in secondary somatic embryogenesis of Quercus robur L.,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,secondary embryogenesis; growth regulators; histology; oak; PEDC,IMMATURE ZYGOTIC EMBRYOS; PLANT-REGENERATION; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; ORIGIN; CULTURES; SUBER; SEQUENCE; EXPLANTS; INVITRO; CELLS,"Standardized explants composed of hypocotyl and root-tip were prepared from embryonic structures obtained from one embryogenic line of Quercus robur L. maintained by regular transfer onto a solidified reference medium composed of the MS mineral solutions, glucose (0.12 M), casamino acid (0.1%), and NAA (10.74 muM). The regeneration capacity from these explants were tested on the reference medium and on 2 alternative media in which the NAA (10.74 muM) was omitted or substituted for a combination of IBA (9.80 muM)/ BAP (8.90 muM). Within 30 days, 4 types of responses were observed including direct and indirect secondary embryogenesis. In the direct pathway, somatic embryos arose from 3-4 epidermal cells following two different modes, depending on whether or not the formation of a meristematic mass preceded the initiation of the embryogenic process. In the indirect pathway the embryos were formed from clumps of mitotically active cells included in callus developed within the cortical tissues. Depending on their histological origin, the embryos exhibited differences in their structural organization which could influence their potential for further maturation and conversion into viable plantlets. Explants prepared from small translucent embryonic structures were more embryogenic and expressed the direct pathway of secondary embryogenesis at higher frequency than explants prepared from more advanced embryonic structures. On the culture medium without growth regulator, direct secondary embryogenesis was the exclusive response whereas on the culture medium with growth regulators added both direct and indirect secondary embryogenesis occurred. NAA favoured the direct secondary embryogenesis, while conversely, the IBA/BAP combination stimulated the indirect secondary embryogenesis. The results are discussed in reference to the PEDC concept (pre-embryogenic determined cells).","Fac Sci, UHP Nancy Interact Arbres Microorganismes, Unite Mixte Rech INRA, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Favre, JM (reprint author), Fac Sci, UHP Nancy Interact Arbres Microorganismes, Unite Mixte Rech INRA, BP 239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",,,,,,,47,16,19,0,2,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

The investigated population was located in Wadi Hof near Helwan city. Additional water in relatively wet years cause these ephemeral plants to live longer and become perennials. The species has ephemeral, modular and coppiced life-cycles and may shift from a r- to a K-selected strategy. The germinable seed bank represented 15.6%, of the total seed rain, out of which only 0.03% established as adult plants. About 72.7% of the adult plants were ephemeral. 27.0% modular and 0.3% coppiced plants. The highest contribution of the seed rain came from modular plants and the lowest contribution from coppiced plants. The survivorship curve of the coppiced plants exhibited a combination of Deevey type I and III curves. The ephemeral and modular plants showed steep curves. In contrast to ephemeral plants, the coppiced plants attained the highest reproductive value and the lowest reproductive effort, while the modular plants demonstrated intermediate values. The active phenological cycle started earlier in coppiced plants than in the modular and ephemeral plants, The period from the start of vegetative growth to shoot-die back extends from mid-December to early June in coppiced plants, from February to May in modular plants, and from late February to early May in ephemeral plants. The living stumps of the coppiced plants remained dormant during summer and autumn months. Seeds collected from coppiced plants attained high germinabiltiy and viability, while those from ephemeral and modular plants attained low values. Seed longevity was higher in the modular plants ( > 10 yr) than in seeds of ephemeral and coppiced plants (7-8 yr). The high energy content of the seeds produced from different cohorts over ten years of storage enabled the population to maximize the germinability, viability and longevity of seeds despite the unpredictable environment. The potential annual behaviour of D. harra is mainly attained by the persistence of viable seed bank and root-shoot stock. The ability to shift from a r- to a K-selected life-cycle, phenological variations among the different cohorts of the population, variations in seed longevity and energy content strengthen intra-population interactions.","Cairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Giza 12613, Egypt","Hegazy, AK (reprint author), Cairo Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Giza 12613, Egypt.",,,,,,,42,19,21,0,8,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2001,24,4,,,,,403,412,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.d01-196.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,485KJ,WOS:000171753300004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Luo, YQ; Wu, LH; Andrews, JA; White, L; Matamala, R; Schafer, KVR; Schlesinger, WH",,,,"Luo, YQ; Wu, LH; Andrews, JA; White, L; Matamala, R; Schafer, KVR; Schlesinger, WH",,,Elevated CO2 differentiates ecosystem carbon processes: Deconvolution analysis of Duke Forest FACE data,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon flux; carbon sink; CO2; convolution and deconvolution; forest ecosystem; forward modeling; global change; inverse analysis; root exudation; root turnover; soil carbon processes; terrestrial-carbon sequestration (TCS),NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FINE-ROOT; DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT; INCREASING CO2; WATER-CONTENT; PLANT; PINE; RESPIRATION,"Quantification of the flux of carbon (C) through different pathways is critical to predict the impact of global change on terrestrial ecosystems. Past research has encountered considerable difficulty in separating root exudation, root turnover rate, and other belowground C fluxes as affected by elevated CO2. In this study we adopted a deconvolution analysis to differentiate C flux pathways in forest soils and to quantify the flux through those pathways. We first conducted forward analysis using a terrestrial-C sequestration (TCS) model to generate four alternative patterns of convolved responses of soil surface respiration to a step increase in atmospheric CO2. The model was then validated against measured soil respiration at ambient CO2 before it was used to deconvolve the CO2 stimulation of soil respiration. Deconvolved data from the Duke Forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment suggest that fast C transfer processes, e.g., root exudation, are of minor importance in the ecosystem C cycling in the Duke Forest and were not affected by elevated CO2. The analysis indicates that the fine-root turnover is a major process adding C to the rhizosphere. This C has a residence time of several months to similar to2 yr and increases significantly with increased CO2, In addition, the observed phase shift in soil respiration caused by elevated CO2 can be only reproduced by incorporation of a partial time delay function in C fluxes into the model. This paper also provides a detailed explanation of deconvolution analysis, since it is a relatively new research technique in ecology.","Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Math, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",yluo@ou.edu,,,,,,76,69,76,3,25,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",15-Dec,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Study aims were (i) to identify differences in drought sensitivity among the tree organs (leaf, stem or root) and between the tree species, and (ii) to test the hypothesis that differences in whole-tree drought response are relevant for competition between Fagus and Quercus in Central European mixed stands. Drought had only weak or no influence on A,, and L of the two species during the 5 years; the only exception being a severe drought in 1990 with an A,,, reduction of Fagus by 30%. Stem diameter growth of Fagus was significantly smaller in dry than in wet summers; in contrast, no clear stem growth/moisture relationship was detected for Quercus during the study period. Soil water deficits apparently stimulated fine-root,growth of Fagus during the dry mid-summer 1995, thus compensating for root biomass losses due to high root mortalities in this period. Quercus fine-root biomass and productivity were not significantly influenced by this drought. A higher drought sensitivity of stem diameter growth, fine-root production and photosynthesis in Fagus corresponded to a larger inter-annual variability of the predawn leaf water potential between wet and dry summers and generally smaller leaf conductances of this species compared to Quercus. Quercus was less sensitive to drought in its growth processes, but showed larger inter-annual variabilities of the osmotic potentials of the leaf symplasm and of the seasonal minima of bulk leaf turgor compared to Fagus. Thus, Fagus is competitively superior in mixture with Quercus despite its higher sensitivity to soil water deficits. It is concluded that a whole-plant perspective rather than a leaf-centred view of drought response is needed to predict the consequences of water shortage for ecosystem-level processes, such as tree competition and succession driven by climate change.

In this paper, total root biomass and root distribution data of 27 trees from the northern Kazakh steppe were approximated by allometric functions depending on tree height, stump diameter, root diameter class, and optionally, depth in the ground. Our regressions offer good overall approximations to the data except for the uppermost horizon and the thickest roots (which include the stump). Logarithmic standard deviations range from 0.23 to 0.39 for total root biomass and from 0.74 to 1.09 for root distribution, and R-2 range from 0.96 to 0.98 and from 0.76 to 0.89, respectively. Although the original goal of constructing a cumulative function in both root diameter class and depth in the ground was not attained due to unfavourable statistical conditions, bivariate interpolation can be used with our functions to overcome the limitations of the set of class boundaries used. In addition, regressions were developed which eliminate the need to measure stump diameter and maximum depth of root penetration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A gas exchange model, based on the optimality approach, derived the effect of drought from the probability of rains. A carbon-and nitrogen-balance growth model applied structural regularities of a tree and a modification of functional balance between foliage and fine roots as growth-guiding rules. Adaptation to local climates was incorporated in the models. The simulations yielded physiologically reasonable behaviour for annual photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) in relation to the distributions of precipitation over the course of a year. An annual temperature increase of 2 degreesC and a prolonged dry season (scenario 2) reduced A by 5-11% and E by 5-8% as compared to present climate (scenario 1). Doubled CO2 concentration and the increased temperature (scenario 3) enhanced A by 56-59% and E by 14%. Simultaneously these changes (scenario 4) increased A by 41-53% and E by 1-5%. Simulated growth in scenario 1 fitted reasonably well to field data. By the age of five years, simulated total biomass (TB) and height (h) were reduced by 31-67% and 12-42%, respectively, in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1. In scenario 3, TB and h increased by 279-330% and 94-191%, and in scenario 4, by 83-241% and 55-69%, respectively. Large increases in TB and h are explained by the exponential growth phase of the young seedlings. These results suggest that climatic changes enhance growth and thus shorten the duration of the grass stage in these seedlings. However, the effects of climatic changes on growth depend strongly on how rainfall seasonality is altered in SE Asia because prolonged drought episodes may retard the fertilizing effects of the increasing CO2 concentration.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Trop Silviculture Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koskela, J (reprint author), Int Plant Genet Resources Inst, Reg Off Asia Pacific & Oceania, POB 236,UPM PO, Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",,,,,,,47,2,2,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Continuous measurements Of Soil CO2 efflux, soil temperatures and moisture were conducted on two 20 x 20 m sampling plots. Microbial biomass, fine root biomass, and the physical and chemical properties of the soil were also measured at each of the 18 sampling locations on the plots. It was found that the mean soil CO2 efflux in the plantation was 4.43 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the growing season and 3.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the nongrowing season. These values are in the upper part of the range of published soil-surface CO2 efflux data. The annual maximum and minimum CO2 efflux were 5.87 and 1.67 mu mol m-2 s-1, respectively, with the maximum occurring between the end of May and early June and the minimum in December. The diurnal fluctuation Of CO2 efflux was relatively small (< 20%) with the minimum appearing around 09.00 hours and the maximum around 14.00 hours. Using daytime measurements Of Soil CO2 efflux tends to overestimate the daily mean Soil CO2 efflux by 4-6%. The measurements taken between 09.00 and 11.00 hours (local time) seem to better represent the daily mean with a reduced sampling error of 0.9-1.5%. The spatial variation of soil CO2 efflux among the 18 sampling points was high, with a coefficient of variation of approximately 30%. Most (84%) of the spatial variation was explained by fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and soil physical and chemical properties. Although soil temperature and moisture explained most of the temporal variations (76-95%) Of Soil CO2 efflux, the two variables together explained less than 34% of the spatial variation. Microbial biomass, fine root biomass, soil nitrogen content, organic matter content, and magnesium content were significantly and positively correlated with soil CO2 efflux, whereas bulk density and pH value were negatively correlated with CO2 efflux. The relationship between soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature was significantly controlled by soil moisture with a Q(10) value of 1.4 when soil moisture was <14% and 1.8 when soil moisture was >14%. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations is essential to accurately assessment of carbon budget at whole ecosystem and landscape scales. Thus, this study bears important implications for the study of large-scale ecosystem dynamics, particularly in response to climatic variations and management regimes.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Xu, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 135 Giannini Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,46,409,590,7,142,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, few carbon budgets exist for these forests, and the effects of wildfire, the dominant natural disturbance in this region, on carbon budgets are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of wildfire on carbon distribution and net primary production (NPP) for three major Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) forest ecosystems in Tahe, Daxing' anling, north-eastern China: Larix gmelinii-Ledum palustre, Larix gmelinii-grass and Larix gmelinii-Rhododendron dahurica forests. The experimental design included mature forests (unburned), and lightly and heavily burned forests from the 1.3-million-ha 1987 wildfire. We measured carbon distribution and above-ground NPP, and estimated fine root production from literature values. Total ecosystem carbon content for the mature forests was greatest for Larix-Ledum forests (251.4 t C ha(-1)) and smallest for Larix-grass forests (123.8 t C ha(-1)). Larix-Ledum forests contained the smallest vegetation carbon (13.5%), while Larix-Rhododendron contained the largest vegetation carbon (63.1%). Fires tended to transfer carbon from vegetation to detritus and soil. Total NPP did not differ significantly between the lightly burned and unburned stands, and averaged 1.58, 1.29 and 1.01 t C ha(-1) year(-1) for Larix-grass, Larix-Rhododendron and Larix-Ledum lightly burned stands, respectively. Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of heavily burned stands was 92-95% less than unburned and lightly burned stands. The estimated carbon loss during the 1987 fire showed substantial variability among forest types and fire severity levels. Depending upon the assumptions made about the fraction of the landscape occupied by the three larch forest types, the 1987 conflagration in north-east China released 2.5 x 10(7)- 4.9 x 10(7) t C to the atmosphere. This study illustrates the need to distinguish between the different larch forests for developing general carbon budgets.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA; NE Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Resources & Environm, Ecol Sect, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China","Wang, CK (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ckwang@calshp.cals.wisc.edu,"Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426",,,,40,81,112,1,60,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The intraspecific diversity was high, ranging from 22 to 33 different electrophoretic types for G. claroideum. and 15-27 for Glomus DAOM 225952 depending on the population. Resampling experiments showed that the number of polymorphic bands was sufficient to score all multilocus profiles in the populations and to describe the clonality structure within populations. On average, one multilocus profile was represented by about four spores whatever the Population and the species. Partitioning of the within-species phenotypic variance showed that more than 92% of the variation was found, within populations., while the among-population variance component accounted for less than 8%, even though it was statistically different from 0. This result is confirmed by the fact that only few multilocus profiles were shared by two populations of G. claroideum. and none by populations of Glomus DAOM 225952. In addition to the high level of diversity observed within populations, linkage disequilibria analyses and association indices calculated across loci indicates that reproduction cannot be solely clonal.

In gaps, height growth was stimulated by removal of either the apical meristem or 10% of leaf tissue; growth was reduced only after 90% foliage removal. 3 Higher damage levels increased subsequent net leaf loss. Leaf production was much greater, but leaf retention much lower, in gaps than in the understorey. Ninety per cent foliage removal drastically reduced production in gaps and retention in the understorey. After 10% defoliation, height growth was enhanced in gaps despite approximately 30% net leaf loss. 4 In a separate experiment. juveniles were moved from a shade house to gaps. After 8 months, gap plants had more leaves and more total biomass, but only half the root : shoot ratio of plants left in the shade. 5 Allocation patterns, together with the survival of understorey plants after all but the highest levels of damage, indicate that root : shoot allocation there tends to reduce the risk of mortality following herbivore or mechanical damage at the expense of growth. In contrast, in gaps, where interference competition for light is high, resource allocation apparently maximizes height growth. The interaction between resource availability and herbivore damage provides the basis for a more synthetic theory of resource allocation and growth strategies than one based on resource availability alone.","Dartmouth Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Blundell, AG (reprint author), US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, Amer Assoc Advancement Sci, 1200 Penn St NW,Mail Stop 8601 D, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",,,,,,,45,53,55,0,30,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In this study, we established molecular techniques in order to identify fine roots of the 30 most common tree species of the Alps. We developed a protocol for efficient isolation of DNA from fine roots with extraction of DNA in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP). The trnL (UAA) intron of plastid DNA was used as a marker for fine root identification. We amplified and sequenced this intron with plant universal primers. The size of the sequences ranged from 444 to 672 bp. A synoptic key for species identification was designed on the basis of restriction fragment patterns predicted from sequence data. Using the restriction enzyme TaqI as key enzyme, and where necessary HinfI, RsaI and CfoI, 16 taxa, including Picea abies, Larix decidua, Abies alba, and Fagus sylvatica, the dominant tree species of the Alpine region could be identified by agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction fragments. Fourteen taxa could be identified to the genus level, among them Quercus, Salix and Populus species. In a field study, conducted in a 20 x 30 m plot of a mixed forest with five tree species, fine roots of 43 out of 46 samples were identified and their distributions were mapped. These results demonstrate the utility of our DNA extraction method and of the trnL intron for the identification of fine tree roots.","Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Brunner, I (reprint author), Swiss Fed Res Inst, WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",,"Brunner, Ivano/J-8661-2014; Sperisen, Christoph/S-1383-2019","Brunner, Ivano/0000-0003-3436-995X; Sperisen, Christoph/0000-0003-1241-5636",,,,37,59,62,1,22,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

The sinorhizobial strains were unable to effectively nodulate Sesbania rostrata (Papilionoideae). All roots had hairs, but particularly in the case of Acacia spp. they were often sparse. After inoculation root hairs were deformed and, in general, infection in Acacia spp. occurred through short root hairs and in Prosopis spp. through longer ones. After entry, the rhizobia filled infection pockets in the root hair, which later expanded into sac-like structures. When infection threads occurred, they usually started from sac-like structures. Elongation and ramification of the nodules indicated that Acacia spp. and Prosopis spp. have indeterminate nodules. A persistent apical meristem, which is the characteristic feature of the indeterminate nodule type, was much clearer in Prosopis spp. than in Acacia spp. Sinorhizobial strains formed tumour-like structures with undifferentiated cell tissue on the Australian acacia A. holosericea and ineffective, nodule-like structures on the African P. africana.","Univ Helsinki, Bioctr 1, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Dundee, Dept Biol Sci, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland","Rasanen, LA (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Bioctr 1, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Lindstrom, Kristina/0000-0001-9499-1797",,,,60,31,31,0,13,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2001,235,2,,,,,193,210,,10.1023/A:1011901706936,,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,477RR,WOS:000171298500008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Peramaki, M; Nikinmaa, E; Sevanto, S; Ilvesniemi, H; Siivola, E; Hari, P; Vesala, T",,,,"Peramaki, M; Nikinmaa, E; Sevanto, S; Ilvesniemi, H; Siivola, E; Hari, P; Vesala, T",,,Tree stem diameter variations and transpiration in Scots pine: an analysis using a dynamic sap flow model,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Traveling Workshop on Canopy Dynamics and Forest Management - A Missing Link,"AUG 01-11, 1999","SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, UPPSALA, SWEDEN","Int Union Forest Res Org, Global Change & Terrestrial Ecosyst, Estonian Agr Univ, Tartu Univ, Univ Foensuu, Finnish Forest Res Inst",SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,Pinus sylvestris; water tension; xylem diameter change,WATER TRANSPORT; XYLEM; PRESSURE; WOOD; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CONDUCTANCE; EXCHANGE; FOREST; PLANTS,"A dynamic model for simulating water flow in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tree was developed. The model is based on the cohesion theory and the assumption that fluctuating water tension driven by transpiration, together with the elasticity of wood tissue, causes variations in the diameter of a tree stem and branches. The change in xylem diameter can be linked to water tension in accordance with Hooke's law. The model was tested against field measurements of the diurnal xylem diameter change at different heights in a 37-year-old Scots pine at Hyytiala, southern Finland (61 degrees 51 'N, 24 degrees 17 'E, 181 in a.s.l.). Shoot transpiration and soil water potential were input data for the model. The biomechanical and hydraulic properties of wood and fine root hydraulic conductance were estimated from simulated and measured stem diameter changes during the course of day. The estimated parameters attained values similar to literature values. The ratios of estimated parameters to literature values ranged from 0.5 to 0.9. The model predictions (stem diameters at several heights) were in close agreement with the measurements for a period of 6 days. The time lag between changes in transpiration rate and in sap flow rate at the base of the tree was about half an hour. The analysis showed that 40% of the resistance between the soil and the top of the tree was located in the rhizosphere. Modeling the water tension gradient and consequent woody diameter changes offer a convenient means of studying the link between wood hydraulic conductivity and control of transpiration.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Helsinki Univ Technol, Appl Elect Labs, FIN-02150 Espoo, Finland","Peramaki, M (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB 24, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,"Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017","Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; Nikinmaa, Eero/0000-0003-4956-3069",,,,40,95,107,2,28,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,AUG,2001,21,13-Dec,,,,,889,897,,10.1093/treephys/21.12-13.889,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,468XC,WOS:000170782600013,11498336,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Duponnois, R; Plenchette, C; Thioulouse, J; Cadet, P",,,,"Duponnois, R; Plenchette, C; Thioulouse, J; Cadet, P",,,The mycorrhizal soil infectivity and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore communities in soils of different aged fallows in Senegal,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; Sahelian zone; mycorrhizal soil infectivity potential,AGGREGATE STABILITY; INOCULATION; POPULATIONS; PHOSPHORUS; PHOSPHATE; CAMEROON; SYSTEMS; PLANTS; FOREST; HYPHAE,"This work was carried out to determine the influence of the duration of fallow and of physico-chemical components of soils on the distribution of endomycorrhizal fungal spores and the mycorrhizal soil infectivity.

In recent years, many experiments have been conducted to determine temperate forest NEE. These data have been used by forest modellers to better understand the processes that govern CO, fluxes, and estimate the evolution of these fluxes under changing environmental conditions. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether models capable of handling short-term processes, which are mostly source-driven, can provide an accurate estimate of long-term forest growth, which is potentially more influenced by sink- and phenology-related processes. To analyse the interactions between short- and long-term processes, we developed the ASPECTS model, which predicts long-term forest growth by integrating, over time, hourly NEE estimates. Validation data consisting of measurements of NEE by eddy-covariance and forest carbon reservoir estimates were obtained from mixed deciduous and evergreen experimental forests located in Belgium. ASPECTS accurately estimated both: (1) the NEE fluxes for several years of data; and (2) the amount of carbon contained in stems, branches, leaves, fine and coarse roots. Our simulations demonstrated that: (1) NEE measurements in Belgian forests are compatible with forest growth over the course of the 20th century, and (2) that forest history and long-term processes need to be considered for accurate simulation of short-term CO2 fluxes.

Walp. cv. B89-504, under water-stressed conditions in the greenhouse were studied. The 3 x 2 experimental design included two levels of mycorrhizal colonisation (Glomus mosseae, Glomus versiforme) and non-mycorrhizal control treatment and two soil moisture levels (well-watered pots and pots allowed to dry). Relative water content and leaf water potential values were higher in well-watered mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants than in water-stressed mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. AM species had no significant effect on leaf osmotic potential, stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration in both well watered and water-stressed plants. The values of stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration were high during the vegetative stage and low during the flowering stage. These responses which can be related to the age of the plant suggest that mycorrhizal colonisation did not affect stomatal closure of cowpea plants during water stress. The decrease in plant growth and dry matter production in both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants shows that drought resistance in cowpea was unaffected by mycorrhiza in the vegetative phase.

We focus on both patterns of specie replacement and various processes that occur during succession, and suggest that the sequence of processes may be predictable even if species composition is not. We describe forest recovery with respect to old-growth conditions, which we define as the structure, function, and composition of the original forest before conversion, and we examine this recovery process within the context of type and intensity of past land use. The various phases of the recovery process are described in derail: from factors affecting early colonization, changes in light and soil properties, soil-vegetation feedbacks at initial and later successional stages, biomass accumulation, forest productivity, rates of species accumulation, and species composition. The consensus of these analyses is that the regenerative power of Neotropical forest vegetation is high, if propagule sources are close by and land use intensity before abandonment has not been severe. Nevertheless, the recovery of biophysical properties and vegetation is heavily dependent on the interactions between site-specific factors and land use, which makes it extremely difficult to predict successional trajectories in anthropogenic settings. We attempt, throughout this review, to integrate the structural and functional characteristics of secondary succession as a way to enhance our ability both to predict and manage successional forest ecosystems due to their increasing importance as timber sources, providers of environmental services, and templates for restoration purposes.

These amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 5.8S gene sequences indicated that the six clone sequences obtained were of different origins. Five sequences, P1-9, P2-6, P4-4, P4-5, and P4-7, belonged to the fungi and one sequence, P3-2, belonged to the plants. P1-9 was inferred to belong to the Basidiomycota based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 5.8S gene sequences but could not be identified to lower taxonomic levels. Further identification of the other four fungal clones to lower taxonomic levels was attempted based on phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison of both the conserved 5.8S gene and the variable ITS regions, The origin of P2-6 was identified to be Glomerella and its anamorph Colletotrichum, the origins of P4-5 and P4-7 were Mycosphaerella and its anamorph Cladosporium, and the origin of P4-4 was the Herpotrichiellaceae. The direct approach to detection and taxonomic placement of endophytic fungi within host tissue without the need for conventional in vitro culturing is discussed.

In fact, only a very small fraction of the biomass can be in this condition at any time due to substrate limitations. Our hypothesis is that the microbial biomass expends energy to maintain a large ATP concentration and high AEC despite the expenditure of valuable energy reserves because this strategy offers an evolutionary advantage over one based on resting spores. Thus, by the time a spore becomes active in response to the presence of a suitable substrate, a more speculative organism may have captured it. We found that trace concentrations (i.e. mug g(-1) quantities) of appropriate 'trigger solutions' of glucose, amino acids and root exudates can cause the biomass to evolve about 2- to 5-times more C as CO2 than was contained in the original 'trigger solution'. The effect (essentially a ""priming effect"") was mainly over with a single addition after 200 h, but the biomass could be reactivated with further additions. Addition of 'trigger solutions' to soils recently amended with cellulose produced an accelerated rate of mineralization of the cellulose until the experiment was terminated. We consider that our results describe a previously unreported response of the microbial biomass which equips it for survival in the generally substrate-poor soil environment.

Hexokinase, which utilizes ATP as a phosphagen was active in the all components of both fungi, suggesting that glucose can be metabolized generally through glycolysis/PPP. Polyphosphateglucakinase-type activity, in which polyphosphate is utilized as a phosphagen, was detectable in the spores and intraradical hyphae of both fungi but negligible compared with that of hexokinase.

Topsoil horizons show a reduction in depth from 20 cm in ungrazed sites to 16 cm in grazed sites, mainly as a consequence of soil compression caused by animal hooves. Bulk density values in the first 5 cm of the profile in grazed sites are approximately 27% higher than those in ungrazed sites. Total porosity values in the top few centimeters are, on average, 17% lower in grazed sites, primarily due to the collapse of macropores (>50 mum) and larger mesopores (50-9 mum). Water retention curves for the three depths in the different patches reflect the changes in pore space distribution. Grazing causes a sharp increase in mechanical impedance-an average increment of 210% over ungrazed values in the first 10 cm of soil. There are marked differences in the degree of aggregation in grazed sites compared with ungrazed sites. The former show a lower quantity and density of roots in the top few centimeters of the profile. Changes are also evident in average root diameter as a result of vegetation substitution brought on by overgrazing. The lack of significant differences in soil physical properties in areas subject to different grazing intensities underscores the gravity of the problem caused by animal traffic, which poses a serious threat to the conservation and recovery of the grazed patches.","Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Peinemann, N (reprint author), Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Agron, Av Constituyentes S-N, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",,,"Villamil, Maria/0000-0003-3559-8981",,,,34,37,51,1,13,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,JUL,2001,166,7,,,,,441,452,,10.1097/00010694-200107000-00002,,,12,Soil Science,Agriculture,457HE,WOS:000170130400002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hubbert, KR; Graham, RC; Anderson, MA",,,,"Hubbert, KR; Graham, RC; Anderson, MA",,,Soil and weathered bedrock: Components of a Jeffrey pine plantation substrate,SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; ROOT DISTRIBUTION; GRANITIC BEDROCK; WATER STATUS; ROCK; FOREST; CALIFORNIA; MORPHOLOGY; TREES,"Virtually all of the commercial forests in the southern Sierra Nevada are on granitic terrain, where bedrock may be weathered to depths > 15 m while soils are <1 m thick. Because plant-available water is depleted in these thin soils by midsummer, study objectives were to characterize the edaphic role of the weathered bedrock relative to the soil. The site was a 30-yr-old Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) plantation growing on relatively thin soils (75 cm in depth) overlying weathered granitic bedrock. The average depth to hard bedrock was 350 cm. A trench was excavated and physical and chemical properties of the soil and bedrock were evaluated. Cation-exchange capacities (CEC) were lower in the weathered bedrock (Cr1 horizon = 4.6 cmol kg(-1)) than in the soil (A horizon = 13.4 cmol kg(-1)), but pH values were similar (4.6-5.5). Organic C content was negligible in the weathered bedrock matrix (<0.1%), but was higher within joint fractures (3.7%), where roots were concentrated, than,within the soil A horizon (2.7%). Carbon/N ratios were much lower in the soil A horizon (19.6) than in the bedrock fractures (62.0). Saturated hydraulic conductivities (K-sat) of the soil and the weathered bedrock were similar and high (8-11 cm h(-1)). Mean root length density (RLD) was greater within the joint fractures than within the soil, but on a whole rock basis bedrock RLD was much lower (<0.08 cm cm(-3)). Total plant-available water storage capacity of 48.8 cm was calculated for the 350 em thickness of regolith, with 14.7 cm (30%) contributed by soil and 34.1 cm (70%) by weathered bedrock. Weathered bedrock underlying soils is critical to the survival of forest ecosystems, particularly with regard to water supply, and should not be neglected in ecosystem site evaluations and models.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Soil & Water Sci Program, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Hubbert, KR (reprint author), USDA, Forest Serv, Pacific SW Res Stn, Forest Fire Lab, 4955 Canyon Crest Dr, Riverside, CA 92507 USA.",,,,,,,52,42,47,0,18,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Compared to A.tortilis, A.xanthophloea seedlings showed higher leaf area, relative growth rates and total dry weight production under adequate water supply conditions. However, with increased water stress, A. xanthophloea seedlings could not alter their pattern of carbon allocation, retaining their root:shoot (r:s) ratio of about 0.5. By comparison, A. tortilis seedlings shifted carbon allocation to the roots, leading to a r:s ratio of 1.5 in water-stressed seedlings, compared to 0.5 in the control plants. The ability of A. tortilis to reallocate carbon to the roots away from the shoots and to actually increase root growth compared to A. xanthophloea was a dehydration postponement strategy that may be important in species survival during drought.","Univ Nairobi, Dept Bot, Nairobi, Kenya; Kenya Forestry Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya","Kinyamario, JI (reprint author), Univ Nairobi, Dept Bot, POB 30197, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,21,17,17,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-6707,,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

All roots were collected and divided into live and dead parental roots and new root categories. Size and age of parent roots at the time of suckering were determined. Total biomass ranged from 1 to 18 t/ha of live roots. Living root biomass was proportional to stand density and leaf area index (LAI). Low-density stands had a higher proportion of dead roots. Suckers in plots with more parental root biomass/sucker had greater height growth. Root/shoot ratios ranged from 0.46 to 3.52 but were not correlated with stand densities. Stands with larger basal area of suckers and greater mean parent root diameter produced more biomass of new roots.

These are small-sized plantations of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) within large complexes of conifer stands. In the presented paper the influence of beech on soil and the growth of beech were investigated in comparison with neighbouring even-aged spruce stands (Picea abies [L.] KARST) 60 years after planting. For this purpose, 10 pairs of investigation plots were selected in which soil profiles were ditched, samples of the humus layer and the mineral soil were taken, and root density and the diversity of Lumbricidae were investigated. Further, the growth of the stands was recorded. In all investigation plots a homogenous soil substrate was found: a stony, gravelly, silty loam originated from carboneous schists and sandstones mixed with loess. A brown earth-pseudogley-soil association has developed. The soil density is looser under beech than under spruce. The beech humus layer had a higher pH, a closer UN ratio and a better supply of calcium and magnesium. On the other hand, in the mineral soil no significant chemical differences between the two tree species were found except for a higher pH value under beech. Beech roots were found to be deeper and denser in the soil volume between trunks than spruce (beech: 0.9m deep, 5 fine roots/dm(2) roots on average from 0 to 40 cm depth; spruce: 0.7 m deep, 1.5 fine roots/dm(2)). Species and individuals of Lumbricidae are more numerous under beech than under spruce. The beech stands were 59, the spruce stands 48 years old. Beech reached a height growth bonity of 28 m (II, 0), spruce, 31 m (I, 8). The installation of long-term trial plots and expansion to other regions are recommended for further installation.","Thuringer Fachhsch Forstwirtschaft Schwarzburg, D-07427 Schwarzburg, Germany","Heinze, M (reprint author), Thuringer Fachhsch Forstwirtschaft Schwarzburg, D-07427 Schwarzburg, Germany.",,,,,,,34,6,6,0,0,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0015-8003,,,FORSTWISS CENTRALBL,Forstwiss.

The contribution of N storage and remobilization to the vegetative and reproductive growth of the forb Rumex acetosa was quantified using N-15 labelling techniques with plants derived from semi-natural grasslands in Scotland. 2. The contribution of remobilized N to the total N in the new above-ground tissues was highest at the beginning of the growing season at 58%. New leaves and reproductive organs contained equal amounts of remobilized N. 3. During early vegetative growth, the taproot was the main source of remobilized N, whereas during reproductive growth, N was additionally remobilized from fine roots and leaves. 4. Free amino acids (mainly arginine and glutamine) and proteins were identified as the main storage compounds in the taproots. The protein pool did not show any seasonal variations that indicated the existence of a vegetative storage protein, indicating that such proteins are not a necessary component of N storage/remobilization in all species. 5.

Water uptake is linked to photosynthetic carbon assimilation through a photosynthesis model for C-3 plants. 2 A genetic algorithm is used to identify character suites that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain for plants that experience a particular soil moisture pattern. The character suites include allocation fraction to stem, leaves and shallow root, stem capacitance and stem water storage capacity, maximal leaf conductance and sensitivity of leaf conductance to plant water potential, and a critical soil water potential at which shallow roots cease to transfer water. 3 We find that if pulse water is a more important water source than deeper soil water in the environment, optimal phenotypes lean towards adaptations that maximize pulse water use (small root : shoot ratio, predominantly shallow root system, high leaf conductance with high stomatal sensitivity to plant water status). if deeper soil water is more important, phenotypes lean towards adaptations that maximize deeper soil water use (large root : shoot ratio, predominantly deep root system, lower leaf conductance with low stomatal sensitivity). Stem succulence is adaptive only when deeper soil water is unavailable. 4 From among the continuum of derived phenotypes, four phenotypes are selected that resemble the character suites of winter annuals, drought-deciduous perennials, evergreen perennials and stem succulents. Under common conditions, these phenotypes reproduce many of the responses to drought and water pulse observed in their respective life-form counterparts. The comparison also highlights the differences in plant life-form sensitivity to summer and winter drought conditions. 5 Based on these results, we discuss the possible role of annual precipitation patterns in shaping plant adaptations and determining the plant composition of arid and semi-arid environments.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Schwinning, S (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257S 1400E, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291",,,,72,259,313,5,147,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

In response to a signal cascade coded by genes of both symbiotic partners, a specific plant organ, the nodule, is formed. Rhizobial nodulation (nod) genes trigger nodule formation through the synthesis of Nod factors, a family of chitolipooligo-saccharides that are specifically recognized by the host plant at the first stages of the nodulation process. Here, we present the organization and sequence of the common nod genes from Rhizobium galegae, a symbiotic member of the Rhizobiaceae. This species has an intriguing phylogenetic position, being symbiotic among pathogenic agrobacteria, which induce tumors instead of nodules in plant shoots or roots. This apparent incongruence raises special interest in the origin of the symbiotic apparatus of R. galegae. Our analysis of DNA sequence data indicated that the organization of the common nod gene region of R. galegae was similar to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum, with nodIJ downstream of nodABC and the regulatory nodD gene closely linked to the common nod operon. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of the nod gene sequences showed a close relationship especially between the common nodA sequences of R. galegae, S. meliloti, and R. leguminosarum biovars viciae and trifolii. This relationship in structure and sequence contrasts with the phylogeny based on 16S rRNA, which groups R. galegae close to agrobacteria and separate from most other rhizobia. The topology of the nodA tree was similar to that of the corresponding host plant tree. Taken together, these observations indicate that lateral nod gene transfer occurred from fast-growing rhizobia toward agrobacteria, after which the symbiotic apparatus evolved under host plant constraint.","Univ Helsinki, Bioctr 1, Div Microbiol, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Boston, MA USA; Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Mol Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Suominen, L (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Bioctr 1, Div Microbiol, Dept Appl Chem & Microbiol, POB 56, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",leena.suominen@helsinki.fi,,"Lindstrom, Kristina/0000-0001-9499-1797",,,,69,47,49,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0737-4038,,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

We investigated the effects of ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition and diversity on the productivity and growth characteristics of seedlings of two tree species (Pinus sylvetris and Betula pendula) as well as their interactions with each other. This involved setting up a mycorrhizal fungal diversity gradient from one to eight species using a design previously demonstrated to be able to separate diversity effects from compositional effects. We found that the eight mycorrhizal fungal species differed in their effects on seedling productivity and that the nature of effects was determined by the fertility of the substrate. Fungal species richness effects were also important in affecting seedling productivity over and above what could be explained by ""sampling effect"" but only in some situations. For B. pendula in a low fertility substrate there were clear positive causative effects between fungal species richness and productivity with the eight species treatment having over double the productivity of any of the eight monoculture treatments; no diversity effects were, however, detected in a high fertility substrate. For P. sylvestris in a high fertility substrate there were significant negative effects of fungal diversity on productivity while in a low fertility substrate no effects were apparent. The possible mechanistic bases for these results are discussed. The growth of P. sylvestris relative to that of B. pendula when grown in combination was unaffected by mycorrhizal treatments. Our results provide clear evidence that effects of mycorrhizal fungal diversity on productivity are context dependent and may be positive, negative or neutral depending on the situation considered.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Jonsson, LM (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",,"Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335",,,,44,156,166,1,44,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2001,93,3,,,,,353,364,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.930301.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,452YK,WOS:000169887100001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Curt, T; Lucot, E; Bouchaud, M",,,,"Curt, T; Lucot, E; Bouchaud, M",,,"Douglas-fir root biomass and rooting profile in relation to soils in a mid-elevation area (Beaujolais Mounts, France)",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,root system; fine root biomass; Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco; soil fertility,MENZIESII MIRB FRANCO; FINE-ROOT; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; STANDS; TURNOVER; BEECH; PRODUCTIVITY; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS,"Douglas-fir is the main reforestation species in the French Massif Central area (14 000 ha), but little is known about its rooting strategy in different soil conditions. This information has important implications for the choice of better soils for settling Douglas-fir, and consequently limiting risks of failure, pests or diseases. As a result, the influence of edaphic conditions on rooting patterns of dominant Douglas-fir was studied over a large range of ecological conditions in a mid-elevation area of the French Massif Central (Beaujolais Mounts). Root systems were studied extensively using the trench profile wall technique and the sector method in 74 pure and evenly aged Douglas-fir stands. The stands were chosen as being representative of soil conditions among 165 stands in an auto-ecological study. The rooting patterns were related to seven typical soil profiles, and to root profile groups. Results stressed that edaphic constraints due to substratum and soil structures have a strong influence on root system morphology. Important variations in root biomass and vertical distribution were highlighted among soils. Small fine root biomass is maximal for soils with no major edaphic constraints. The vertical distribution of fine root biomass is positively correlated for some soil types with organic C, total N, and most cations. For some types it was negatively correlated with the amount of exchangeable aluminum and coarse fragments, and with constraining rock facies. Harsher soils however, showed no correlation between soil chemical variables and fine-root biomass. A practical implication is that Douglas-fir seems to be a pliable and adaptive species: variation in habit and root system biomass are considerable within a study area which was presumed uniform.","Cemagref Forest & Agroforestry Res Unit, F-63172 Aubiere, France; Univ Franche Comte, EA MENRT 2280, Biol & Ecophysiol Res Team, F-25030 Besancon, France","Curt, T (reprint author), Cemagref Forest & Agroforestry Res Unit, 24 Av Landais,BP 50085, F-63172 Aubiere, France.",,,,,,,57,18,23,0,21,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2001,233,1,,,,,109,125,,10.1023/A:1010333308738,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,443GG,WOS:000169332300009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rillig, MC; Wright, SF; Nichols, KA; Schmidt, WF; Torn, MS",,,,"Rillig, MC; Wright, SF; Nichols, KA; Schmidt, WF; Torn, MS",,,Large contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to soil carbon pools in tropical forest soils,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,glomalin; microbial biomass; soil carbon; soil chronosequence; hyphae,ECOSYSTEM; HYPHAE; ACCUMULATION; COLONIZATION; ASSOCIATIONS; EXTRACTION; FRACTIONS; DYNAMICS; GLOMALIN; ECONOMY,"The origins and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) are still largely uncertain. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are recognized as indirect contributors through their influence on soil aggregation, plant physiology, and plant community composition. Here we present evidence that AMF can also make large, direct contributions to SOM. Glomalin, a recently discovered glycoprotein produced by AMF hyphae, was detected in tropical soils in concentrations of over 60 mg cm(-3). Along a chronosequence of soils spanning ages from 300 to 4.1 Mio years, a pattern of glomalin concentrations is consistent with the hypothesis that this protein accumulates in soil. Carbon dating of glomalin indicated turnover at time scales of several years to decades, much longer than the turnover of AMF hyphae (which is assumed to be on the order of days to weeks). This suggests that contributions of mycorrhizae to soil carbon storage based on hyphal biomass in soil and roots may be an underestimate. The amount of C and N in glomalin represented a sizeable amount (ca. 4-5%) of total soil C and N in the oldest soils. Our results thus indicate that microbial (fungal) carbon that is not derived from above- or below-ground litter can make a significant contribution to soil carbon and nitrogen pools and can far exceed the contributions of soil microbial biomass (ranging from 0.08 to 0.2% of total C for the oldest soils).","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; ARS, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Ctr Isotope Geochem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, HS 104, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009; Torn, Margaret S/D-2305-2015","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853; Torn, Margaret S/0000-0002-8174-0099",,,,39,281,336,4,193,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2001,233,2,,,,,167,177,,10.1023/A:1010364221169,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,448UB,WOS:000169647400003,,,,,10/31/19J,"Niklaus, PA; Wohlfender, M; Siegwolf, R; Korner, C",,,,"Niklaus, PA; Wohlfender, M; Siegwolf, R; Korner, C",,,"Effects of six years atmospheric CO2 enrichment on plant, soil, and soil microbial C of a calcareous grassland",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,C-13 labelling; carbon isotope discrimination; carbon sequestration; earthworms; soil physical fractionation,CARBON-DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT; ELEVATED CO2; IN-SITU; ORGANIC-MATTER; DECOMPOSITION RATES; N-AVAILABILITY; ROOT SYSTEMS; LEAF-LITTER; FOOD-WEB; BIOMASS,"Stimulated plant production and often even larger stimulation of photosynthesis at elevated CO2 raise the possibility of increased C storage in plants and soils. We analysed ecosystem C partitioning and soil C fluxes in calcareous grassland exposed to elevated CO2 for 6 years. At elevated CO2, C pools increased in plants (+23%) and surface litter (+24%), but were not altered in microbes and soil organic matter. Soils were fractionated into particle size and density separates. The amount of low-density macroorganic C, an indicator of particulate soil C inputs from root litter, was not affected by elevated CO2. Incorporation of C fixed during the experiment (C-new) was tracked by C isotopic analysis of soil fractions which were labelled due to C-13 depletion of the commercial CO2 used for atmospheric enrichment. This data constrains estimates of C sequestration (absolute upper bound) and indicates where in soils potentially sequestered C is stored. C-new entered soils at an initial rate of 210 +/- 42 g C m(-2) year(-1), but only 554 +/- 39 g C-new m(-2) were recovered after 6 years due to the low mean residence time of 1.8 years. Previous process-oriented measurements did not indicate increased plant-soil C fluxes at elevated CO2 in the same system (C-13 kinetics in soil microbes and fine roots after pulse labelling, and minirhizotron observations). Overall experimental evidence suggests that C storage under elevated CO2 occurred only in rapidly turned-over fractions such as plants and detritus, and that potential extra soil C inputs were rapidly re-mineralised. We argue that this inference does not conflict with the observed increases in photosynthetic fixation at elevated CO2, because these are not good predictors of plant growth and soil C fluxes for allometric reasons. C sequestration in this natural system may also be lower than suggested by plant biomass responses to elevated CO2 because C storage may be limited by stabilisation of C-new in slowly turned-over soil fractions (a prerequisite for long-term storage) rather than by the magnitude of C inputs per se.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Niklaus, PA (reprint author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 11 052, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014; Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010","Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357",,,,79,40,43,1,33,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2001,233,2,,,,,189,202,,10.1023/A:1010389724977,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,448UB,WOS:000169647400005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Yoshida, LC; Gamon, JA; Andersen, CP",,,,"Yoshida, LC; Gamon, JA; Andersen, CP",,,Differences in above- and below-ground responses to ozone between two populations of a perennial grass,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; Elymus glaucus (blue wildrye); Glomus intraradices; ozone; perennial grass,TAEDA L SEEDLINGS; CARBON ALLOCATION; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL RESPIRATION; GROWTH; ROOTS; STRESS; COLONIZATION; RHIZOSPHERE; DEPOSITION,"Our study examined the influence of elevated ozone levels on the growth and mycorrhizal colonization of two populations of Elymus glaucus L. (blue wildrye). We hypothesized that ozone would reduce carbon availability to the plants, particularly below ground, and would affect mycorrhizal colonization. Because of the wide geographic range of E. glaucus, two populations of plants were selected from areas of contrasting ozone histories to examine intraspecies variation in response to ozone. Two populations of E. glaucus (southern California versus northern California) exposed in a factorial experiment involving ozone, mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices Schenck and Smith, and plant source population. Ozone had a subtle effect on leaf area and number of tillers but did not affect overall root:shoot ratio in either population. The impact of ozone on above-ground growth characteristics was most pronounced in the southern population that came from a high-ozone environment, while below-ground responses such as reduced arbuscular colonization was most pronounced in the northern population which originated in a low-ozone environment. Further analysis of soil characteristics from the northern population of plants revealed a significant reduction in active soil bacterial biomass and an increase in total fungi per gram dry weight soil, suggesting a possible role for ozone in altering soil processes. Whether or not population differences in response to ozone were due to genetic shifts resulting from prior ozone remains to be determined. However, these subtle but important differences in population response to ozone above- and below-ground have significant implications in any attempt to generalize plant response, even within a species. Future research efforts need to include better characterization of intraspecific variation in response to ozone as well as possible adaptive strategies that may result from chronic ozone exposure.","US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA","Yoshida, LC (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Biol Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,"Gamon, John/A-2641-2014","Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723",,,,59,17,23,1,27,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JUN,2001,233,2,,,,,203,211,,10.1023/A:1010321509628,,,9,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,448UB,WOS:000169647400006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Petropoulou, Y; Georgiou, O; Psaras, GK; Manetas, Y",,,,"Petropoulou, Y; Georgiou, O; Psaras, GK; Manetas, Y",,,"The growth, flower properties and demography of Anthemis arvensis exposed to enhanced UV-B radiation",PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Anthemis arvensis; floret surface; flower demography; flower properties; UV-B radiation,FIELD CONDITIONS; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; CISTUS-CRETICUS; LEAVES,"The winter annual species Anthemis arvensis L.

Enhanced UV-B radiation had no effect on the methanol extractable UV-B absorbing capacity of leaves, phenological and morphometric parameters of anthesis (flowering time, anthesis duration, head life span, number of heads per plant, number of tubular and ligulate florets per head, area per ligulate floret). Concerning the optical properties of heads, enhanced UV-B radiation had no significant effect on the extractable absorbance of both floret types nor on the spectral reflectance of the tubular florets. However, under UV-B supplementation the white ligulate florets exhibited a slight, statistically significant decrease of reflectance in the visible region of the spectrum. This may be due to structural changes of the floret surface, since microscopic examination under SEM revealed the papillae of the adaxial epidermal cells to be swollen. The above ground dry mass measured at plant harvest was not affected but a significant increase in root biomass (and accordingly in root/shoot ratio) was observed.

A second manipulation was performed to evaluate the relative roles of submergence depth and plant anatomy in isopod colonization preference. Detached aerial prop roots were oriented either with the root tip directed downward, or upside down with the root tip directed upward but at a constant water depth. Additionally, detached aerial prop roots were oriented so that their tips were in contact with the sediment surface in order to investigate whether colonization on grounded roots was prevented by benthic predators. For all experiments, colonization began within 24 hr juveniles were the predominant colonizers. The submergence depth of a prop root, a characteristic of a root's physical setting, was consistently the strongest component correlated with the abundance of colonizing S. terebrans. The root-quality feature of root diameter was also found to play a significant role in colonization. Biotic influences, such as predation, however, did not influence recruitment of the isopod onto a root. Additionally, the absence of burrowing on grounded roots appeared to be related to intrinsic plant features. Along a root there was a strong preference by S. terebrans to colonize the root tip region (i.e., youngest part of the root) especially when these roots were also the deepest. The results of our experimental manipulation using natural root substratum are the first to identify physical setting as an important feature of habitat suitability for S. terebrans.","Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Brooks, RA (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",,,,,,,35,10,13,0,18,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2001,127,4,,,,,522,532,,10.1007/s004420000619,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,440YK,WOS:000169204100009,28547490,,,,10/31/19J,"Bala, A; Murphy, P; Giller, KE",,,,"Bala, A; Murphy, P; Giller, KE",,,Genetic diversity of rhizobia from natural populations varies with the soil dilution sampled,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Calliandra; Leucaena; Gliricidia; PCR-RFLP; most probable number; nodulation; N-2-fixation,SPACER REGION; NODULATION; IDENTIFICATION; LEGUMINOSARUM; COMPETITION; MELILOTI; BACTERIA; LEGUMES; STRAINS,Rhizobia were isolated from root nodules of three tree legumes inoculated with dilution series of two tropical soils.

Such effects have not been documented for Mediterranean woodland and scrubland areas. This research evaluated humus profiles beneath pine and adjacent vegetation on the basis of previous knowledge on soil animal communities and vegetation. Two Mediterranean sites with aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis P, Mill.) and scrubland vegetation were compared, one in Spain (Navarre), the other in Italy (Sicily), Humus profiles were sampled under main vegetation types, comprising aleppo pine, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L,), and bare ground in both sites, along transects with increasing pine influence. Quantitative morphological methods were used to analyze and compare humus profiles, and data were analyzed using correspondence analysis. In both sites the influence of aleppo pine on humus forms was well-defined but minor, increasing the appearance of an Oe horizon characterized by intense activity of litter-dwelling Fauna and fungi, Under all vegetation types, and in both sites, the organomineral A horizon was of the mull type, although the composition of the soil-building fauna varied between Navarre and Sicily, There was more heterogeneity among vegetation types in Navarre, where aleppo pine was planted on derelict land, than in Sicily where aleppo pine was a component of natural vegetation (maquis), A decreasing influence of pine was perceptible in the inner edge of the pine plantation in Navarre, or under the crown of individual trees in Sicily.","Musem Natl Hist Nat, Lab Ecol Gen, F-91800 Brunoy, France; Univ Navarra, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool & Ecol, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain","Ponge, JF (reprint author), Musem Natl Hist Nat, Lab Ecol Gen, 4 Ave Petit Chateau, F-91800 Brunoy, France.",,"Jordana, Rafael/F-6867-2017; Ponge, Jean-Francois/D-5089-2009; Arino, Arturo H./A-2262-2012","Jordana, Rafael/0000-0001-9088-787X; Ponge, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-6504-5267; Arino, Arturo H./0000-0003-4620-6445",,,,63,36,36,1,6,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Sol. mycorrhizas formed by an IAA-overproducing mutant of Hebeloma cylindrosporum Romagnesi or by the corresponding wild type with non-mycorrhizal short roots. Both wildtype and mutant strains induced an increase in root diameter that was mostly a result of the influence of the fungus on root cortical development. Both strains affected growth polarity of P. pinaster cortical cells and induced a change in their shape. The main modifications were a large reduction in axial diameter and an increase in the radial diameter of the cortical cells. The modifications were more marked with the mutant than with the wild type. The mutant induced a 43% reduction in cortical cell elongation and a 35% increase in radial diameter, whereas the corresponding changes induced by the wild type were 30 and 10%, respectively. The volume of cortical cells in mature mycorrhizas was generally lower than in uninoculated short roots indicating that wild-type and mutant strains induced a reorientation of cortical cell growth but did not induce an increase in turgor pressure of the cells. Immunolocalization allowed visualization of a-tubulin in root cortical cells, but no obvious modification in a-tubulin distribution was detected as a consequence of symbiosis establishment. Likewise, cytochemical localization of polysaccharides in cortical cell walls did not show significant modification following symbiosis establishment and Hartig net formation. The only noticeable modification was a reduction in cortical cell wall thickness in mycorrhizas compared with uninoculated short roots. The possible involvement of fungal auxin in the observed modifications is discussed.","Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Microbienne, UMR 5557, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","Gay, G (reprint author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Microbienne, UMR 5557, Bat 405,43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",,,,,,,27,16,17,0,5,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAY,2001,21,8,,,,,533,540,,10.1093/treephys/21.8.533,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,439KU,WOS:000169116700006,11359711,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Lopez, B; Sabate, S; Gracia, CA",,,,"Lopez, B; Sabate, S; Gracia, CA",,,"Vertical distribution of fine root density, length density, area index and mean diameter in a Quercus ilex forest",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,holm oak; minirhizotron; soil water,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; PINE; TURNOVER; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; PLANTATION; ECOSYSTEMS; SYSTEM,"We used minirhizotrons to determine the vertical distribution of fine roots in a helm oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest in a typical Mediterranean area over a 3-year period (June 1994-March 1997).

Based on root cores collected on six sampling dates from April through November 1998, maximum standing live root biomass occurred approximately 1 month earlier in the growing season in the site burned three times, presumably because of increased soil temperature after the fires. Standing live fine root biomass was significantly lower in the site burned three times in three of the six sampling dates (April, June, and November) and when averaged over the whole growing season. Most of this effect was due to lesser root biomass in the most mesic landscape position. New root production was measured during three ingrowth core intervals: April to August 1998, August to November 1998, and August 1998 to November 1999. Net production was significantly greater in sample plots in xeric landscape positions during each sampling interval. Overall, differences in standing root biomass were inversely correlated with fire-induced changes in N mineralization and increased soil temperature after burning shifted the phenology of root biomass accumulation earlier in the growing season.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Dress, WJ (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 1735 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",dress.1@osu.edu,,,,,,46,14,14,0,0,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Ectomycorrhizal plants that are not selected for harvest (refuge plants) may, therefore, be important for the maintenance of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum in clearcuts following logging. The purpose of this study was to identify refuge plants that could provide ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum for outplanted seedlings. The ectomycorrhizal status of selected plants was assessed in 1.6-ha clearcuts and in adjacent forest. Over 3 years, 17 and 14 morphotypes were described for Pseudostuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas-fir) and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng, respectively. Ten morphotypes (six of these confirmed with restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns) were shared by both species. Anatomical and molecular analyses revealed that, for the morphotypes observed, ectomycorrhizal fungi formed ectomycorrhizal anatomy when associated with Douglas-fir and arbutoid anatomy with A. uva-ursi. Because advanced regeneration seedlings of Douglas-fir and A. uva-ursi are well distributed throughout this site, these two species have a high potential to provide ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum for outplanted seedlings. There was no difference in mycorrhizal richness between A. uva-ursi plants sampled from the clearcut and forest in the latter 2 years of the study. Conversely, the richness of ectomycorrhizae associated with Douglas-fir sampled from the forest was significantly greater than for seedlings sampled from the clearcuts.","Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada","Durall, DM (reprint author), Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",,,"Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126",,,,53,57,59,2,27,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explore relationships between fungal species composition and environmental factors. Richness and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased with elevation, in spite of the fact that host plant diversity was highest at the ecotone between the subalpine forest and the alpine zone. Both host plant distribution and edaphic factors were important in explaining the observed changes in fungal species diversity and composition. The majority of ectomycorrhizal fungi found in the subalpine forest and at the ecotone were conifer associates, while a large proportion of those in the alpine zone were non-host specific and able to form mycorrhizae with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. The abundance of non-host specific fungi in the alpine zone is expected to provide a favorable environment for the establishment of conifer seedlings above the present tree line.","Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Kernaghan, G (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, CP 8888 Succ A, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",cl444@er.uqam.ca,"Harper, Karen/R-4735-2019",,,,,43,62,70,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,APR,2001,24,2,,,,,181,188,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240208.x,,,8,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,445KG,WOS:000169456200008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Clark, DA; Brown, S; Kicklighter, DW; Chambers, JQ; Thomlinson, JR; Ni, J",,,,"Clark, DA; Brown, S; Kicklighter, DW; Chambers, JQ; Thomlinson, JR; Ni, J",,,Measuring net primary production in forests: Concepts and field methods,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,"biomass increment; boreal, temperate and tropical forests; carbon; coarse roots; fine root turnover; forest inventory plots; litterfall; net ecosystem C exchange; net primary production; total belowground carbon allocation",TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; FINE-ROOT PRODUCTION; SUBTROPICAL DRY FOREST; BARRO-COLORADO-ISLAND; DECIDUOUS FOREST; CARBON BALANCE; BOREAL FOREST; PUERTO-RICO; AMAZONIAN FORESTS; EASTERN AMAZONIA,"There are pressing reasons for developing a better understanding of net primary production (NPP) in the world's forests. These ecosystems play a large role in the world's carbon budget, and their dynamics, which are likely to be responding to global changes in climate and atmospheric composition, have major economic implications and impacts on global biodiversity, Although there is a long history of forest NPP studies in the ecological literature, current understanding of ecosystem-level production remains limited, Forest NPP cannot be directly measured; it must be approached by indirect methods. To date, field measurements have been largely restricted to a few aspects of NPP; methods are still lacking for field assessment of others, and past studies have involved confusion about the types of measurements needed. As a result, existing field-based estimates of forest NPP are likely to be significant underestimates. In this paper we provide a conceptual framework to guide efforts toward improved estimates of forest NPP. We define the quantity NPP* as the summed classes of organic material that should be measured or estimated in field studies for an estimate of total NPP. We discuss the above- and belowground components of NPP* and the available methods for measuring them in the field, We then assess the implications of the limitations of past studies for current understanding of NPP in forest ecosystems, discuss how field NPP* measurements can be used to complement tower-based studies of forest carbon flux, and recommend design criteria for future field studies of forest NPP.","Univ Missouri, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ Puerto Rico, Inst Trop Ecosyst Studies, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","Clark, DA (reprint author), INTERLINK 341,POB 02-5635, Miami, FL 33102 USA.",,"Chambers, Jeffrey Q/J-9021-2014; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Chambers, Jeffrey Q/0000-0003-3983-7847; Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",,,,96,535,586,5,215,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Seedlings of the dominant C-4 grasses from tallgrass prairie, Schizachyrium scoparium and Andropogon gerardii, were grown for 8 weeks in an elongated, controlled environment chamber at CO2 concentrations of 368 (ambient) and 203 (subambient) mu mol mol(-1).

Both root and shoot systems of C-4 grass seedlings responded similarly to CO2 enrichment irrespective of whether soil water was limiting or abundant. Root growth was affected primarily by increased RWC (40-51% increases) and secondarily by higher CO2 (15-27% increases). The relative distribution of root surface area, number of root tips and length and volume of roots were significantly affected by CO2 enrichment with proportional increases of 55-61%, 39-52%, 50-55% and 53-58%, respectively, occurring in very fine (0-0.3 mm) roots. The indirect effect of CO2 enrichment on conservation of soil water in grasslands may be as important as direct photosynthetic response effects in the CO2-induced enhancement of whole-plant growth in C-4 grasses.","USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA","Derner, JD (reprint author), USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, 808 E Blackland Rd, Temple, TX 76502 USA.",,,"Polley, Herbert/0000-0002-1197-8800",,,,33,10,12,0,13,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2001,231,1,,,,,97,104,,10.1023/A:1010306720328,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,423UK,WOS:000168196000010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Johansson, M",,,,"Johansson, M",,,Fungal associations of Danish Calluna vulgaris roots with special reference to ericoid mycorrhiza,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Calluna vulgaris; dark sterile fungi; ericoid mycorrhiza; heathland; Hymenoscyphus ericae; Oidiodendron spp.,HYMENOSCYPHUS-ERICAE; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI; ALPINE; PLANTS; NITROGEN; HULL,"Fungi were isolated from young, serial-washed roots of Calluna sampled from a Danish heathland, Hjelm Hede.

We hypothesised that root system size is closely linked to the plant's ecological strategy, and that seed size is correlated with root diameter, as a result of, anatomical constraints. We analysed the relationships between root characteristics - root depth, basal root diameter and root type - and other plant attributes in more than 300 plant species from two ecologically and geographically contrasted areas: Britain and NE Spain. We used statistical tests that took into account phylogenetic patterns in the data. Apart from plant life span, only plant height and seed size were related to root size in the adult plants. Plant species with shallow or thin main roots had smaller seeds than species with deep or thick main roots, and species with taproots had bigger seeds than plants with fibrous or especially with adventitious roots. These relationships were consistent in the two floras. Seed size was related to plant height, but this association was weaker than that between seed size and root depth. Root depth explained a significant proportion of the variation in seed weight, independently from life form or dispersal mode and, in some cases, more than either of them. These results suggest that traditional ecological explanations do not adequately explain the relationship between seed and plant adult size, and that there will be other, complementary explanations. In particular, we propose that the relationship between seed size and plant height is secondary. The putative causal sequence is that deep-rooted plants (which are generally taller) have large seeds because of allometric and developmental constraints that mean that only large seeds can produce the thick roots that can grow rapidly to depth.

The objective of this work was to characterize 61 rhizobial isolates from eight species of native legume trees: Acacia caven, Inga uruguensis, Lonchocarpus nitidus, Prosopis nigra, Sesbania virgata, Peltophorum dubium, Enterolobium contortisiliquum and Erythrina crista-galli. The strains were isolated from nodules with high nitrogenase activity and their growth rate, antibiotic, salinity and acidity resistances were determined. Their relationships were analyzed building a matrix with the resistance characteristics. Most of the isolates were fast growers and acid-producing with high level of exopolysaccharides. In general, isolates were erythromycin resistant but sensitive to rifampicin. All the isolates grew well at pH 5.5 while 75% did so at pH 4.4. More than 60% of the isolates grew in 2% of NaCl but this declined to 21% of the isolates in 3% NaCl. This population showed high antibiotic, salinity and pH resistance, suggesting adaptability to major ecological environment stresses, and great saprohytic competence within soil environments. Isolates from the same host showed high homology between them. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Karst.) and in a mixed stand of both species. Radial root growth was assessed for roots greater than 5 mm diameter by growth ring analysis. Beech roots showed maximum density at the 10- to 20-cm depth, whereas the density of spruce roots decreased exponentially with increasing soil depth. Roots of both species reached the maximum excavation depth (1 m) in their monospecific stands. However, the root system of spruce was shallower in the mixture with beech, where large roots (diameter (d) > 20 mm) were limited to the upper 10 cm. Beech roots reached the same rooting depth as in the pure stand but showed higher root densities in deeper soil layers. Neither root diameter nor root growth of any species was correlated with soil depth. Radial root growth of beech exceeded that of spruce significantly in both pure and mixed stands. Radial growth rate of beech roots further increased when mixed with spruce. The enhancement of beech root growth in the mixed stand suggests a higher belowground competitive ability of beech compared with spruce; as a result the spruce root system developed even shallower in the mixed versus in the pure stand.","Univ Ulm, Dept Systemat Bot & Ecol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany","Schmid, I (reprint author), Univ Ulm, Dept Systemat Bot & Ecol, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",,,,,,,29,72,78,6,31,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

ANPP was related to leaf area index and aspect (p=0.0336 and p=0.0031, respectively), as was BGPP (p=0.0185 and p=0.0016, respectively). ANPP and BGPP were both greater on the north aspect at any given leaf area index (LAI). Above-ground production of the understory was also higher on the north aspect. Litterfall from all vegetation combined represented the largest share of ANPP; increases in overstory biomass represented the next largest share. Soil CO2 flux was also higher on the north aspect. Despite higher overstory LAI on the north aspect, understory NPP was higher. These results confirm that all measures of productivity, both above- and belowground, were higher on the north aspect than on the south aspect.

Treatment with the leachate significantly decreased height growth and shoot and root dry weights of all species relative to the control treatment. Root:shoot ratios of all tree species except lodgepole pine were increased significantly by application of leachate. The root:shoot ratios of treated C. canadensis were significantly increased during one season, but significantly reduced in the following season.

Overall, mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP, the total amount of carbon (C) fixed during photosynthesis) of these forests was 1380 +/- 330gC m(-2) y(-1) (mean +/- SD). On average, 80% of GPP was respired by autotrophs and heterotrophs and released back into the atmosphere (total ecosystem respiration, TER=1100 +/- 260 gC m(-2) y(-1)). Mean annual soil respiration (SR) was 760 +/- 340 gC m(-2) y(-1) (55% of GPP and 69% of TER). Among the investigated forests, large differences were observed in annual SR and TER that were not correlated with mean annual temperature. However, a significant correlation was observed between annual SR and TER and GPP among the relatively undisturbed forests. On the assumption that (i) root respiration is constrained by the allocation of photosynthates to the roots, which is coupled to productivity, and that (ii) the largest fraction of heterotrophic soil respiration originates from decomposition of young organic matter (leaves, fine roots), whose availability also depends on primary productivity, it is hypothesized that differences in SR among forests are likely to depend more on productivity than on temperature. At sites where soil disturbance has occurred (e.g. ploughing, drainage), soil espiration was a larger component of the ecosystem C budget and deviated from the relationship between annual SR land TER) and GPP observed among the less-disturbed forests. At one particular forest, carbon losses from the soil were so large, that in some years the site became a net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Excluding the disturbed sites from the present analysis reduced mean SR to 660 +/- 290 g C m(-2) y(-1), representing 49% of GPP and 63% of TER in the relatively undisturbed forest ecosystems.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium; Univ Lund, Dept Phys Geog, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Environm & Resources, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Univ Franche Comte, Inst Sci & Tech Environm, F-25211 Montbeliard, France; Riso Natl Lab, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Univ Kiel, Ecosyst Res Ctr, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; Fac Univ Sci Agron Gembloux, Unite Phys, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrol & Meteorol, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; Univ Padua, Dept Land & AgroForestry Syst, Padua, Italy; DLO, Winand Staring Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands; SLU, Dept Prod Ecol, Fac Forestry, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Gottingen, Inst Bioklimatol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Edinburgh, Inst Ecol & Resource Management, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; Agr Res Inst, Dept Environm, IS-112 Reykjavik, Iceland; Autonomous Prov Bolzano, Forest Serv, Bolzano, Italy; INRA Bordeaux, Unite Bioclimatol, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France; Ctr Rech Nancy, Unite Ecophysiol Forestiere, Equipe Bioclimatol, F-54280 Seichamps, France","Janssens, IA (reprint author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Plein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.",,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Pilegaard, Kim/I-7137-2013; Ibrom, Andreas/A-9850-2011; Rebmann, Corinna/R-2359-2019; Olchev, Alexander/A-5079-2016; Epron, Daniel/B-5093-2011; Lindroth, Anders/N-4697-2014; Matteucci, Giorgio/N-3526-2015; Moors, Eddy/J-5165-2012; Gudmundsson, Jon/A-7112-2013; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Kowalski, Andrew S./A-7515-2008; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010; Pilegaard, Kim/H-9026-2019; Montagnani, Leonardo/F-1837-2016; Montagnani, Leonardo/L-9785-2019","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Pilegaard, Kim/0000-0002-5169-5717; Rebmann, Corinna/0000-0002-8665-0375; Olchev, Alexander/0000-0002-6144-5826; Epron, Daniel/0000-0001-9451-3437; Lindroth, Anders/0000-0002-7669-784X; Matteucci, Giorgio/0000-0002-4790-9540; Moors, Eddy/0000-0003-2309-2887; Gudmundsson, Jon/0000-0002-1703-8916; Kowalski, Andrew S./0000-0001-9777-9708; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Pilegaard, Kim/0000-0002-5169-5717; Montagnani, Leonardo/0000-0003-2957-9071; Montagnani, Leonardo/0000-0003-2957-9071; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457; Ibrom, Andreas/0000-0002-1341-921X",,,,60,649,718,6,213,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Photosynthesis can, in theory, directly provide the ATP and reductant needed to support N-2 fixation but the link between these two processes is usually indirect, mediated through accumulated carbon reserves. In cyanobacteria, which possess an oxygenic photosynthesis, this serves to separate the O-2 that is produced by photosynthesis from the O-2-sensitive nitrogenase. However, in certain circumstances, oxygenic photosynthesis and N-2 fixation coexist. Under these conditions, respiratory consumption of photosynthetically generated O-2 may have an important role in minimizing O-2-damage to nitrogenase.","Univ Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Biochem Res Grp, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales","Gallon, JR (reprint author), Univ Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Biochem Res Grp, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",,,,,,,95,47,50,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2001,230,1,,,,,39,48,,10.1023/A:1004640219659,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,410JB,WOS:000167435900005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Ruiz-Argueso, T; Palacios, JM; Imperial, J",,,,"Ruiz-Argueso, T; Palacios, JM; Imperial, J",,,Regulation of the hydrogenase system in Rhizobium leguminosarum,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,FnrN; hydrogen uptake; hydrogenase regulation; NifA; rhizobia; symbiotic expression,BRADYRHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM HYDROGENASE; BV VICIAE; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ALCALIGENES-EUTROPHUS; NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; RHODOBACTER-CAPSULATUS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BIOVAR VICIAE; UPTAKE GENES,"Some rhizobial strains induce in the legume nodule a hydrogenase capable of reducing the hydrogen generated as an obligate by-product of the nitrogenase reaction.

Seasonal fine root biomass presented a cyclic behaviour, with higher values in autumn and winter and lower in spring and summer. Production was highest in winter, and mortality in spring. In summer, production and mortality values were the lowest for the year. Production values in autumn and spring were very similar. The vertical distribution of fine root biomass decreased with increasing depth except for the top 10-20 cm, where values were lower than immediately below. Production and mortality values were similar between 10 and 50 cm depth. In the 0-10 cm and the 50-60 cm depth intervals, both production and mortality were lower.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; CREAF, Edifici Ciencies, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; CEFE, CNRS, DREAM Unit, F-34293 Montpellier, France","Lopez, B (reprint author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Diagonal 645, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Sabate, Santiago/I-3395-2016","Sabate, Santiago/0000-0003-1854-0761",,,,50,64,88,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2001,230,1,,,,,125,134,,10.1023/A:1004824719377,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,410JB,WOS:000167435900014,,,,,10/31/19J,"Grieu, P; Lucero, DW; Ardiani, R; Ehleringer, JR",,,,"Grieu, P; Lucero, DW; Ardiani, R; Ehleringer, JR",,,The mean depth of soil water uptake by two temperate grassland species over time subjected to mild soil water deficit and competitive association,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,deuterium; Lolium perenne; plant competition; Trifolium repens; water deficit; water uptake,STABLE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS L; LOLIUM-PERENNE L; WHITE CLOVER; ROOT-SYSTEM; FINE ROOTS; LEAF WATER; GROWTH; RYEGRASS; PLANT,"Little is known concerning the soil water use dynamics of white clover (WC) and ryegrass (RG) grown in mixtures. A greenhouse study, on a deep soil, was conducted to determine the mean depth of soil water uptake of WC and RG plants grown in a competitive association and subjected to a moderate soil water deficit. Plant growth period simulated that experienced by newly sown grassland in temperate regions. Three irrigation solutions, each containing a different hydrogen isotope (deuterium) concentration, expressed as delta notation (delta), were provided at three different soil depths through specially constructed tubes and containers (0.50 m diameter, 1 m depth) in order to create a soil deuterium profile gradient. Young leaves and not the entire plant were harvested in order to preserve the competitive plant association over time. Patterns of leaf deltaD value were constant for both WC and RG. Lower leaf deltaD values in RG compared to WC was attributed to RG more efficient stomatal control. Increases in the mean depth of soil water uptake as soil water deficit increased was similar between plants. The mean depth of soil water uptake of WC was at all times greater than that of RG. After 3 months of competitive growth, WC roots obtained water from a soil depth 30% greater than that of RG. In our experimental conditions, the ability of WC to obtain water from substantially lower soil depths may give it a competitive advantage over RG during the period subsequent to pasture sowing if surface soil water deficits are experienced and deeper soil layers contain water.","INPL, ENSAIA, INRA, Unite Associe Agron & Environm, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Stable Isotope Ratio Facil Environm Res, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; ERSA, Ente Reg Promoz & Sviluppo Agr, I-33050 Pozzuolo del Friuli, UD, Italy","Grieu, P (reprint author), INPL, ENSAIA, INRA, Unite Associe Agron & Environm, 2 Av Foret de Haye, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",Philippe.Grieu@ensaia.inpl-nancy.fr,"Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010",,,,,66,39,43,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,MAR,2001,230,2,,,,,197,209,,10.1023/A:1010363532118,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,417VE,WOS:000167854300004,,,,,10/31/19J,"Williams, M; Law, BE; Anthoni, PM; Unsworth, MH",,,,"Williams, M; Law, BE; Anthoni, PM; Unsworth, MH",,,Use of a simulation model and ecosystem flux data to examine carbon-water interactions in ponderosa pine,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Workshop on The Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem and Environmental Stress: Past, Present and Furture held in Conjunction with the Annual Air Pollution Workshop",1999,"CORVALLIS, OREGON",,,carbon cycle; drought; ecosystem model; Pinus ponderosa; rooting depth; transpiration; vapor pressure deficit,RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; SEASONAL-VARIATION; VAPOR EXCHANGE; FOREST; SOIL; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; BALANCE; PERMAFROST,"Drought stress plays an important role in determining both the structure and function of forest ecosystems, because of the dose association between the carbon (C) and hydrological cycles. We used a detailed model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to investigate the links between carbon uptake and the hydrological cycle in a mature, open stand of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Metolius river in eastern Oregon over a 2-year period (1996-1997). The model was parameterized from local measurements of vegetation structure, soil properties and meteorology, and tested against independent measurements of ecosystem latent energy (LE) and carbon fluxes and soil water content. Although the 2 years had very different precipitation regimes, annual uptake of C and total transpiration were similar in both years, according to both direct observation and simulations. There were important differences in ratios of evaporation to transpiration, and in the patterns of water abstraction from the soil profile, depending on the frequency of summer storms. Simulations showed that, during periods of maximum water limitation in late summer, plants maintained a remarkably constant evapotranspirative flux because of deep rooting, whereas changes in rates of C accumulation were determined by interactions between atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and stomatal conductance. Sensitivity analyses with the model suggest a highly conservative allocation strategy in the vegetation, focused belowground on accessing a soil volume large enough to buffer summer droughts, and optimized to account for interannual variability in precipitation, The model suggests that increased allocation to leaf area would greatly increase productivity, but with the associated risk of greater soil water depletion and drought stress in some years. By constructing sparse canopies and deep rooting systems, these stands balance reduced productivity in the short term with risk avoidance over the long term.","Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Williams, M (reprint author), Univ Edinburgh, Inst Ecol & Resource Management, Darwin Bldg,Mayfield Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland.",,"Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208",,,,34,107,109,0,41,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2001,21,5,,,,,287,298,,10.1093/treephys/21.5.287,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,417NQ,WOS:000167841400004,11262920,,,,10/31/19J,"Andersen, CP; Hogsett, WE; Plocher, M; Rodecap, K; Lee, EH",,,,"Andersen, CP; Hogsett, WE; Plocher, M; Rodecap, K; Lee, EH",,,Blue wild-rye grass competition increases the effect of ozone on ponderosa pine seedlings,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,"Workshop on The Ponderosa Pine Ecosystem and Environmental Stress: Past, Present and Furture held in Conjunction with the Annual Air Pollution Workshop",1999,"CORVALLIS, OREGON",,,C : N ratio; Elymus glaucus; Pinus ponderosa; root : shoot ratio.,SAN-BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; AIR-POLLUTION; DOUGLAS-FIR; GROWTH; NITROGEN; EXPOSURE; DROUGHT; STRESS; WATER,"Individual ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) seedlings were grown in mesocosms with three densities of blue wild-rye grass (Elymus glaucus Buckl.) (equivalent to 0, 32 or 88 plants m(-2)) to determine if the presence of a natural competitor alters the response of ponderosa pine seedlings to ozone. After 3 years of ozone exposure, grass presence reduced total ponderosa pine dry mass by nearly 50%, whereas ozone alone had no significant effect on ponderosa pine growth. The combination of ozone and grass further reduced needle, stem and branch dry mass significantly below that induced by grass competition alone. Root:shoot ratios increased in response to the combined grass and ozone treatments. Grass competition significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in all ponderosa pine tissue components examined. Starch concentrations were highly variable but did not differ significantly between treatments. Ozone significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in fine roots and stems. In the absence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings tended to have higher tissue N concentrations than controls. In the presence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings had lower N concentrations than controls, resulting in a significant interaction between these two stresses in 1- and 2-year-old needles. Needle C:N ratios decreased in response to grass competition, as a result of increased N concentration and no change in C concentration. The opposite response was observed in ozone-treated seedlings as a result of decreased N concentrations, indicating that ozone-treated seedlings were unable to take up or retain as much nitrogen when grown in the presence of grass. We conclude that ponderosa pine seedlings are more susceptible to ozone when grown in competition with blue wild-rye grass.","US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Dynamac Corp, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Andersen, CP (reprint author), US EPA, Western Ecol Div, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, 200 SW 35Th St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",,,,,,,41,24,26,3,8,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2001,21,5,,,,,319,327,,10.1093/treephys/21.5.319,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,417NQ,WOS:000167841400007,11262923,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Ortega-Larrocea, MP; Siebe, C; Becard, G; Mendez, I; Webster, R",,,,"Ortega-Larrocea, MP; Siebe, C; Becard, G; Mendez, I; Webster, R",,,Impact of a century of wastewater irrigation on the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal spores in the soil of the Mezquital Valley of Mexico,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; vertisol; leptosol; phosphorus; heavy metals; sewage effluent,LONG-TERM IRRIGATION; HEAVY-METAL; POLLUTED SOILS; TAMIL-NADU; FUNGI; INDIA; BIOAVAILABILITY; COMMUNITIES; PHOSPHORUS; DIVERSITY,"Phosphorus (P) and heavy metals introduced into soil by irrigating with sewage effluent can affect the soil's microflora and, in particular, the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

We did so by replicated sampling of all four combinations of soil type and length of irrigation and then estimating the main effects and interactions by analysis of variance. Both kinds of soil appear to have accumulated large quantities of P and heavy metals as a result of the irrigation so that concentrations have approximately doubled and now approach the thresholds for healthy soil. The differences between soil types were comparatively small. Phosphorus was the only element for which there was an interaction between soil type and time under irrigation. The Leptosol contained more spores than the Vertisol, irrespective of the length of the irrigation, and both types contained significantly fewer spores after 90 years of irrigation than after only 5 years. The effect was more evident in Vertisols. Zn contrast, the sporocarpic morphotypes seemed unaffected by the accumulated phosphorus and metals. The sporocarps of Glomus mosseae were twice as abundant in the Leptosol as in the Vertisol, but those of Sclerocystis were equally prevalent in the two types of soil. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To test whether plant-soil C fluxes in natural grassland increase under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, intact calcareous grassland monoliths exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 were pulse-labelled and the dynamics of the C-13 label followed throughout the rest of the growing season. 2, The experiment revealed no increased fluxes of C to soils at elevated CO2. The only changes found were relatively small shifts towards increased C allocation to roots by the end of the growing season. This effect was probably because wetter soil under elevated CO2 prolonged the growing period. At elevated CO2 plant C pools increased below ground (+28%) at the end of the season, resulting in slightly increased root : shoot ratios. Plant C-13 pools increased significantly below ground. There were no effects of CO2 enrichment on C-13 in soil microbes, fine roots or earthworms, 3. Elevated CO2 caused a shift in soil particle size distribution towards smaller aggregate sizes, but had no effect on the total C and C-13 content of low- and high density soil fractions. 4, The absence of effects of CO2 on the labelling of soil microbial biomass, and of C and C-13 accumulation in low-density macro-organic fractions, suggest that there is no significant effect of elevated CO2 on root exudation or turnover, agreeing with published labelling studies, but conflicting with CO2-exchange budgets.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Paul Scherrer Inst, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Niklaus, PA (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",,"Siegwolf, Rolf TW/D-4121-2009; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Siegwolf, Rolf TW/0000-0002-0249-0651; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; ",,,,36,43,48,1,39,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We used activated carbon to manipulate the effects of root exudates of Centaurea maculosa, a noxious weed in much of western North America, on root elongation rates and growth of the native bunchgrass Festuca idahoensis in order to investigate the relative importance of allelopathy in the total interference of Centaurea. In root observation chambers, Festuca root elongation rates decreased to approximate to 50% of the control, beginning 4 days before contacting Centaurea roots in silica sand. However, when activated carbon, which has a high affinity for adsorbing to organic compounds, was added to the sand the effects of Centaurea roots on Festuca root elongation were reduced. In other experiments, Festuca plants were 50% smaller when grown with Centaurea than with conspecifics in pure silica sand. However, Festuca grown with Centaurea in mixtures of sand and activated carbon were 85% larger than Festuca grown with Centaurea in silica sand without carbon. These results suggest that allelopathy accounts for a substantial proportion of the total interference of Centaurea on Festuca, shifting the balance of competition in favor of Centaurea. However, Centaurea outperformed Festuca even in the presence of activated carbon, demonstrating the importance of the combined roles of resource competition and allelopathy.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Callaway, RM (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,,,,,,38,318,378,2,174,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2001,126,3,,,,,444,450,,10.1007/s004420000533,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,401CZ,WOS:000166910700018,28547460,,,,10/31/19J,"Mikola, J; Yeates, GW; Barker, GM; Wardle, DA; Bonner, KI",,,,"Mikola, J; Yeates, GW; Barker, GM; Wardle, DA; Bonner, KI",,,Effects of defoliation intensity on soil food-web properties in an experimental grassland community,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PLANT-HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS; TROPHIC-LEVEL BIOMASSES; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; UPLAND GRASSLAND; BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CARBON ALLOCATION; SHORTGRASS STEPPE; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; SERENGETI PLAINS,"We established a greenhouse experiment based on replicated mini-ecosystems to evaluate the effects of defoliation intensity on soil food-web properties in grasslands. Plant communities, composed of white clover (Trifolium repens), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and plantain (Plantago lanceolata) with well-established root and shoot systems, were subjected to five defoliation intensity treatments: no trimming (defoliation intensity 0, or DI 0), and trimming of all plant material to 35 cm (DI 1), 25 cm (DI 2), 15 cm (DI 3) and 10 cm (DI 4) above soil surface every second week for 14 weeks. Intensification of defoliation reduced shoot production and standing shoot and root mass of plant communities but increased their root to shoot ratio. Soil microbial activity and biomass decreased with intensification of defoliation. Concentrations of NO3-N in soil steadily increased with intensifying defoliation, whereas NH4-N concentrations did not vary between treatments. Numbers of microbi-detritivorous enchytraeids, bacterial-feeding rotifers and bacterial-feeding nematodes steadily increased with intensifying defoliation, while the abundance of fungal-feeding nematodes was significantly enhanced only in DI 3 and DI 4 relative to DI 0. The abundance of herbivorous nematodes per unit soil mass was lower in DI 3 and DI 4 than in DI 0, DI 1 and DI 2, but when calculated per unit root mass, their abundance tended to increase with defoliation intensity. The abundance of omnivorous and predatory nematodes appeared to be highest in the most intensely defoliated systems. The ratio of abundance of fungal-feeding nematodes to that of bacterial-feeding nematodes was not significantly affected by defoliation intensity. The results infer that defoliation intensity may significantly alter the structure of soil food webs in grasslands, and that defoliation per se is able to induce patterns observed in grazing studies in the field. The results did not support hypotheses that defoliation per se would cause a shift between the bacterial-based and fungal-based energy channels in the decomposer food web, or that herbivore and detritivore densities in soil would be highest under intermediate defoliation. Furthermore, our data for microbes and microbial feeders implies that the effects of defoliation intensity on soil food-web structure may depend on the duration of defoliation and are therefore likely to be dynamic rather than constant in nature.","Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand; Landcare Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand; Landcare Res, Hamilton, New Zealand","Mikola, J (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35 YAC, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,"Barker, Gary M/C-9974-2011; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Mikola, Juha/A-1630-2015","Barker, Gary M/0000-0002-0049-9804; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Mikola, Juha/0000-0002-4336-2648",,,,61,72,82,1,46,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2001,92,2,,,,,333,343,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920216.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,412NF,WOS:000167560700016,,,,,10/31/19J,"Tierney, GL; Fahey, TJ",,,,"Tierney, GL; Fahey, TJ",,,Evaluating minirhizotron estimates of fine root longevity and production in the forest floor of a temperate broadleaf forest,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine roots; longevity; methods; minirhizotron; production; root screens,NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; ECOSYSTEM; TURNOVER; CARBON; DEMOGRAPHY; MORTALITY; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS,"The minirhizotron technique (MR) for in situ measurement of fine root dynamics offers the opportunity to obtain accurate and unbiased estimates of root production in perennial vegetation only if MR tubes do not affect the longevity of fine roots. Assuming fine root biomass is near steady-state, fine root production (g m(-2) yr(-1)) can be estimated as the ratio of fine root biomass (g m(-2)) to median fine root longevity (yr). This study evaluates the critical question of whether MR access tubes affect the longevity of fine roots, by comparing fine root survivorship obtained using MR with those from a non-intrusive in situ screen method in the forest floor horizons of a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. Fine root survivorship was measured in 380 root screens during 1993-1997 and in six horizontal minirhizotron tubes during 1996-1997. No statistically significant difference was found between estimates of survivorship of fine roots (<1 mm dia.) at this site from MR versus from in situ screens, suggesting that MR tubes do not substantially affect fine root longevity in the forest floor of this northern hardwood forest and providing greater confidence in measurements of fine root production using the MR technique. Furthermore, the methodology for estimating fine root production from MR longevity data was evaluated by comparison of fine root longevity and production estimates made using single vs. multiple root cohorts, and using root-number, root-length, and root-mass weighted methods. Our results indicate that fine root-length longevity estimates based on multiple root cohorts throughout the year can be used to approximate fine root biomass production. Using this method, we estimated fine root longevity and production in the forest floor at this site to be 314 days (or 0.86 yr) and 303 g m(-2) yr(-)1, respectively. Fine root production in this northern hardwood forest is approximately equivalent to standing biomass and was previously underestimated by root in-growth cores. We conclude that the use of MR to estimate fine root longevity and production as outlined here may result in improved estimates of fine root production in perennial vegetation.","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tierney, GL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, 8 Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,36,65,81,0,34,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2001,229,2,,,,,167,176,,10.1023/A:1004829423160,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,400JP,WOS:000166868700002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kitayama, K; Iwamoto, K",,,,"Kitayama, K; Iwamoto, K",,,"Patterns of natural N-15 abundance in the leaf-to-soil continuum of tropical rain forests differing in N availability on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,ectomycorrhizas; isotope fractionation; N mineralization; soil N availability; soil profile; tropical rain forests,BRAZILIAN AMAZON BASIN; NITROGEN; PLANTS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; TRANSFORMATIONS; FRACTIONATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; MATRIX; FUNGI,"We investigated the natural abundance of N-15 in sun leaves and other components of tropical rain forests on altitudinal sequences of eight sites that form a gradient of soil N availability with varying ectomycorrhizal abundances on Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. We investigated how soil N availability and ectomycorrhizal abundance related to the N-15 abundance of ecosystem components. delta N-15 values (N-15 abundance relative to N-14) increased consistently in the following order at each site: sun leaves, leaf litter, fine roots and from shallower organic to deeper mineral soil horizons. Enrichment (3-6 parts per thousand delta N-15) of N-15 occurred at the litter-topsoil interface at all sites, and the magnitude of the enrichment correlated negatively with N-15 depletion in the foliage, irrespective of ectomycorrhizal abundance. Foliar delta N-15 values significantly positively correlated with their N concentrations. Foliar (and litter and root) delta N-15 values correlated positively with NO3 availability, and negatively with NH4 availability. The two positive correlations of foliar delta N-15 with foliar N and NO3 availability were inconsistent with the assumption that stronger nitrification (hence a greater nitrate availability) produced a more N-15-depleted active inorganic N pool. The isotopic fractionation during the passage of N through ectomycorrhizas to plants might explain the positive correlation of foliar delta N-15 and N concentration; however, this mechanism could not fully explain the correlation in our case because strong foliar N-15 depletions occurred at the sites that lacked ectomycorrhizas. Alternatively, the positive correlation across sites reflected the tightness of N cycling. Strong nitrification and associated isotopic fractionation might have occurred at N-richer sites and the subsequent removal of NO3 from the system could decrease isotopically 'lighter' N at these sites.","Japanese Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kiso Expt Stn, Nagano 3970001, Japan","Kitayama, K (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",,,,,,,22,30,37,1,26,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2001,229,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1023/A:1004853915544,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,400JP,WOS:000166868700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Bearden, BN",,,,"Bearden, BN",,,Influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on soil structure and soil water characteristics of vertisols,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; draining; porosity; soil structure; water characteristics,AGGREGATE STABILITY; ROOTS; SIZE; RYEGRASS; BIOMASS; HYPHAE,"The influence of inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) on soil water characteristics of fast and slowly wetted vertisol samples was studied. Vertisols characteristically have a low stability to wetting, and the disruption of their larger pores when they swell leads to reduced water infiltration and thereby to runoff. The degree of aggregate breakdown determines the ability of the soil to drain. A vertisol was used in this pot experiment with four treatments: T-1: Pasteurized soil, T-3: Pasteurized soil, with plants, T-4: Inoculated, pasteurized soil, with plants, T-5: Unpasteurized soil, with plants. A treatment using inoculated, pasteurized soil (T-2) was included in a related study (Bearden and Petersen, 2000) comparing aggregate stability, and the present study follows the same numbering to aid in comparison of experiments. After fast, disruptive wetting, the soil inoculated with AM fungi (T-4) was found to have a lower soil water content than did the soils from the other treatments at matric potentials lower than -3.92 kPa. This indicates greater drainage from pores smaller than 75 mum for the soil inoculated with AM fungi, and the greater drainage appears to be directly related to a characteristic pore range between 67 and 75 mum. The soil without plants (T-1), when wetted fast, had a lower soil water content at matric potentials higher than -3.92 kPa than soils from the other treatments, which indicates less pore volume due to pores larger than 75 mum in the treatment without plants. The pore indexes, calculated as the ratio between the slope of the fast and the slope of the slowly-wetted water characteristics, generally had the highest values for the soil inoculated with AM fungi (T-4) from matric potential 0.00 to -0.29 kPa. In this matric potential range, the pore indexes were less than one. The unpasteurized soil with naturally present AM fungi (T-5) generally had the highest pore indexes from matric potential -0.49 to -3.92 kPa, and the pore indexes in this matric potential range were above one. These results indicate the smallest loss of very large pores in the soil inoculated with AM fungi (T-4) and the largest gain of smaller sized pores in the unpasteurized soil (T-5). This suggests that the resistance to breakdown of the largest pores is related to the presence of roots, and that the gain of groups of smaller pores is related to the presence of hyphae.","Danagro Adviser AS, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark","Bearden, BN (reprint author), Danagro Adviser AS, Granskoven 8, DK-2600 Glostrup, Denmark.",,,,,,,26,26,27,3,25,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2001,229,2,,,,,245,258,,,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,400JP,WOS:000166868700010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Rasse, DP; Longdoz, B; Ceulemans, R",,,,"Rasse, DP; Longdoz, B; Ceulemans, R",,,TRAP: a modelling approach to below-ground carbon allocation in temperate forests,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,carbon allocation; coarse roots; fine roots; forest; modelling; soil stress,FINE-ROOT; SCOTS PINE; DECIDUOUS FOREST; HARDWOOD FOREST; NITROGEN STATUS; RESPIRATION; SOIL; BIOMASS; CO2; DYNAMICS,"Tree root systems, which play a major role in below-ground carbon (C) dynamics, are one of the key research areas for estimating long-term C cycling in forest ecosystems. In addition to regulating major C fluxes in the present conditions, tree root systems potentially hold numerous controls over forest responses to a changing environment. The predominant contribution of tree root systems to below-ground C dynamics has been given little emphasis in forest models. We developed the TRAP model, i.e. Tree Root Allocation of Photosynthates, to predict the partitioning of photosynthates between the fine and coarse root systems of trees among series of soil layers. TRAP simulates root system responses to soil stress factors affecting root growth. Validation data were obtained from two Belgian experimental forests, one mostly composed of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and the other of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). TRAP accurately predicted (R = 0.88) night-time CO2 fluxes from the beech forest for a 3-year period. Total fine root biomass of beech was predicted within 6% of measured values, and simulation of fine root distribution among soil layers was accurate. Our simulations suggest that increased soil resistance to root penetration due to reduced soil water content during summer droughts is the major mechanism affecting the distribution of root growth among soil layers of temperate Belgian forests. The simulated annual rate of C input to soil litter due to the fine root turnover of the Scots pine was 207 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The TRAP model predicts that fine root turnover is the single most important source of C to the temperate forest soils of Belgium.","Univ Liege, Lab Phys Atmospher & Planetaire, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Fac Univ Sci Agron, Unite Phys & Chim Phys, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; Univ Antwerp, ULA, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","Rasse, DP (reprint author), Univ Liege, Lab Phys Atmospher & Planetaire, 5 Ave Cointe, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",,"Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016; Rasse, Daniel/H-7279-2019","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; Rasse, Daniel/0000-0002-5977-3863",,,,47,18,22,1,26,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2001,229,2,,,,,281,293,,10.1023/A:1004832119820,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,400JP,WOS:000166868700013,,,,,10/31/19J,"Turnau, K; Berger, A; Loewe, A; Enig, W; Hampp, R; Chalot, M; Dizengremel, P; Kottke, I",,,,"Turnau, K; Berger, A; Loewe, A; Enig, W; Hampp, R; Chalot, M; Dizengremel, P; Kottke, I",,,Carbon dioxide concentration and nitrogen input affect the C and N storage pools in Amanita muscaria-Picea abies mycorrhizae,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,2nd IUFRO International Symposium on Dynamics of Physiological Processes in Woody Roots,"SEP 26-29, 1999","NANCY, FRANCE",Univ Henri Poincare,,CO2; EELS; glycogen; nitrogen; photosynthesis; vacuole,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ENERGY-LOSS SPECTROSCOPY; BEECH FAGUS-SYLVATICA; PAXILLUS-INVOLUTUS; NORWAY SPRUCE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAE; FOREST; POLYPHOSPHATE; PHYSIOLOGY; DEPOSITION,"We studied the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on the vacuolar storage pool of nitrogen-containing compounds and on the glycogen pool in the hyphal sheath of Amanita muscaria (L. ex Fr.)

The numbers and areas of vacuolar N-containing bodies were significantly greater at the higher N concentration only at ambient [CO2]. In the same treatment the percentage of hyphae containing glycogen declined to nearly zero. We conclude that, in the high N/low [CO2] treatment, the mycorrhizal fungus had an insufficient carbohydrate supply, partly because of increased amino acid synthesis by the non-mycorrhizal rootlets.

Circular plots around single beech trees were isolated from roots of neighboring trees by soil trenching, and annual litterfall was replaced by N-15-labeled litter. Nitrogen was continuously released from the decomposing litter. However, over a 2-year period, this release was balanced by the incorporation of exogenous N. Released N accumulated mainly at the soil surface and in the topsoil. Microbial biomass remained almost constant during the experiment at all sites except for considerably lower values at Ebrach. The N-15 enrichment of the microbial biomass increased strongly during the first year and then remained stable. The N-15 released from the decomposing litter was rapidly detected in roots and leaves of the beech trees, increasing regularly and linearly over the course of the experiment. The uptake of litter-released N-15 by the trees was reduced under conditions that reduced tree growth. Under these conditions, leaves and fine roots were the dominant N sinks, and little N was allocated to other plant parts. By contrast, N uptake and N allocation from leaves to stem and bark tissues increased when tree growth was enhanced. Budgets for N-15 showed that 2 to 4% of litter-released N was incorporated into the trees, about 35% remained in the litter and about 50% reached the topsoil.","INRA, Ctr Nancy, Equipe Cycles Biogeochim, F-54280 Champenoux, France; INRA, Ctr Nancy, Equipe Microbiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Zeller, B (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Nancy, Equipe Cycles Biogeochim, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",,,,,,,34,40,42,0,22,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2001,21,3-Feb,,,,,153,162,,10.1093/treephys/21.2-3.153,,,10,Forestry,Forestry,399TW,WOS:000166829300011,11303646,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Grulke, NE; Andersen, CP; Hogsett, WE",,,,"Grulke, NE; Andersen, CP; Hogsett, WE",,,Seasonal changes in above- and belowground carbohydrate concentrations of ponderosa pine along a pollution gradient,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,2nd IUFRO International Symposium on Dynamics of Physiological Processes in Woody Roots,"SEP 26-29, 1999","NANCY, FRANCE",Univ Henri Poincare,,carbohydrate allocation; mature trees; multiple stressors; ozone exposure; Pinus ponderosa,CARBON ALLOCATION; OZONE EXPOSURE; LOBLOLLY-PINE; DOUGLAS-FIR; PHOTOSYNTHATE ALLOCATION; ACIDIC PRECIPITATION; TAEDA SEEDLINGS; GROWTH; PATTERNS; NITROGEN,"Seasonal patterns of carbohydrate concentration in coarse and fine roots, stem or bole, and foliage of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) were described across five tree-age classes from seedlings to mature trees at an atmospherically clean site.

The willows were grown in a stand structure and continuously supplied with water and liquid fertilizer through drip tubes. The lysimeters contained either clay from the site or washed quartz sand. Shoot growth and leaf litter were measured and fine-root dynamics observed in minirhizotrons. Destructive samples were taken annually in late autumn and entire root systems were washed out. Dry mass and N content of all plant parts were determined. Fine-root production was estimated by two methods, based on destructive samplings and observations in minirhizotrons. The proportion of biomass allocated below ground increased considerably when estimates based on accumulated NPP were compared with those based on standing dry mass. In the first year, 49 and 58% of annual NPP in willows grown in clay and sand, respectively, was belowground. In subsequent years the proportions were 36-38% and 33-40%. Most belowground production was fine roots. Relatively more N was used belowground in the first year than subsequently, but no substrate-induced differences were observed in the allocation pattern. Both annual NPP and N uptake was always higher in plants in clay than in those in sand: in the final 2 years, 21-22 tonnes DM ha(-1) year(-1) and 190 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in clay, and 9-10 tonnes DM ha(-1) year(-1) and 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in sand.

Conceptual models have been described that incorporate stream Row characteristics that promote successful regeneration of western riparian Populus seedlings. However, these models need to be calibrated for additional species and specific stream characteristics. In this study, we examined the growth and survival of two dominant Sonoran desert riparian tree species, a native Salix gooddingii, and an exotic, Tamarix chinensis, to simulated water table declines at rates of 0, 1, 2, and 4 cm/day. Salix seedlings performed best in the 0 cm/day treatment in which the soil was saturated and showed decreasing survival and growth with increasing rates of water table decline. Root-to-shoot ratios were high for Salix, but root elongation rates were low with an emphasis on lateral root development. This root growth pattern may be an adaptation to habitat where Salix typically grows, near the stream channel when the water table is shallow but the likelihood of Rood scour is high. Lateral root development may help to protect Salix seedlings from late season flood scour. Tamarix seedlings showed consistently high survival across all treatments and had the greatest growth in the 0 and 1 cm/day treatments. Tamarix seedlings had greater root elongation rates in response to water table decline relative to the control, with the greatest elongation in the 1 cm/day treatment. Greater root elongation rates and higher drought tolerance allowed Tamarix seedlings to persist in dry soils where Salix seedlings died. Differences in growth and survival of these two species in response to water table decline will need to be incorporated into management practices to promote successful native riparian tree regeneration.

Lag ex Griffiths (blue grama). The importance of soil texture, grazing by cattle, disturbance type and severity were evaluated. Two disturbance types (covering or removing tillers) and three disturbance severities (50, 75 and 90% tiller mortality) were used to represent effects of natural disturbances in shortgrass communities (cattle fecal pats, nest sites of Western harvester ants, burrows of small animals). Tiller survival was not affected by soil texture or grazing intensity, but was affected by disturbance type and severity. Plants that were covered showed a 33% increase in tiller survival for all levels of disturbance severity from August (1991) to June (1992). No net change in tiller number was observed for removed or reference plants. Different responses between disturbance types were likely due to increases in root:shoot ratios of covered plants that increased tiller production as a result of increased soil water acquisition. The number of tillers produced was small, but statistically significant (average = 20 tillers/plant), which shows that B. gracilis plants do not produce independent tillers, but consist of integrated physiological units (IPUs). The lack of plant mortality, even with 90% tiller mortality, indicates that small disturbances must kill entire plants before gaps in resource space are produced to initiate gap dynamics that result in the recovery of an individual B. gracilis plant. Because recovery through seedling establishment by B. gracilis occurs infrequently, the ability of this species to survive after partial plant mortality is important to its continued dominance of shortgrass steppe communities in the presence of these small but frequent disturbances.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Peters, DPC (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, USDA ARS, Jornada Expt Range, Box 30003,MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",,,,,,,57,7,7,0,4,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The biomass and biomass increment of broken root ends during excavation was estimated from the diameter of the roots at the broken points. Equations were then established relating the biomass and biomass increment of the different root categories to tree DBH. These equations were then used to estimate the root biomass and biomass increment of the experimental stand from stem inventory, for the different root categories.

A model was applied to actual and theoretical scenarios of climate and soil water supply. Rooted and root-free soil volumes were considered separately because root development was poor for these trees. Input data, i.e., measured flows within the system including sap flow rate, characterize both the period of regular natural floods and period when floods were interrupted for over 20 years because of canalization of rivers in the region. Under non-limiting underground water supply, net precipitation supplied only about 50 and 25% of water for actual evapotranspiration, E-T, under mild and dry weather, respectively, and the other 30 and 60% came from underground sources. The model also characterizes the theoretical situation of no underground water supply, when E-T may decrease significantly. An important limit for water supply to the trees may be the maximum hydraulic conductivity K, allowing horizontal transport in heavy soils, because a small decrease in soil water content (2 to 4%(vol)) causes a large drop in K. K may become supply-limiting before soil water potential becomes a limiting factor. Trees with smaller or damaged root systems or lower root/shoot ratio were especially threatened by drought even on relatively moist heavy soils.","Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Cermak, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,49,35,36,0,3,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

The model, termed SECRETS, is a sequential, multi-species and multiple layer simulator that uses process modules adapted from several sources. Namely, we adapted BIOMASS (maintenance respiration and water balance), and coded the sun/shade model (photosynthesis; modified for forest species), and the GRASSLAND DYNAMICS (soil carbon and nitrogen) models. In this contribution we simulate carbon fluxes for a 70-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and we introduce an approach to characterize uncertainty in the model outputs. Simulated, annual gross primary productivity (GPP) for 1997 and 1998 was 1965 and 1888 g C m(-2), respectively. Soil respiration was 25% (495 g C m(-2) a(-1)) and 27% (505 g C m(-2) a(-1)) of the GPP in 1997 and 1998, respectively, in this slow growing Scots pine stand. Heterotrophic respiration (RH) accounted for, roughly, 32% of the total soil C efflux for both years. Simulated daily fluxes for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) suggested C uptake throughout most, but not all, of the spring and summer, but net release during mid-autumn to early winter periods for both years. Our base estimates of NEE ranged from 385 g C m(-2) a(-1) in 1997 to 310 g C m(-2) a(-1) in 1998. However, the uncertainty in NEE varied from 167 to 509 g C m(-2) a(-1) and 138 to 392 g C m(-2) a(-1) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Thus, this stand may be accumulating C at a rate of 138 to 509 g C m(-2) a(-1) depending on the assumed stand and site characteristics, tree physiology, and local variation in weather.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","Ceulemans, R (reprint author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.",,"Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787",,,,48,31,31,1,7,E D P SCIENCES,LES ULIS CEDEXA,"7, AVE DU HOGGAR, PARC D ACTIVITES COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEXA, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

At that earlier time (1983) research had been initiated on a newly reclaimed site to test the hypothesis that native AM fungi would form effective mycorrhizae and would improve growth of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) in severely disturbed reclamation soil. Data collected during 1984 and 1985 did not support that hypothesis and it was concluded that native AM fungi inoculated onto the site were not tolerant of the altered soil environmental conditions in the reclamation soil. Reexamination of the site in 1997 indicated that soil environmental conditions were becoming more similar to those before disturbance and AM fungal populations were recovering. Soil analyses in 1997 show an approximate 1% increase in soil organic matter content, improvement in soil structure compared to 1983, and decreases in amounts of soluble salts and Na. Mycorrhizal inoculum potential of the disturbed soil and levels of mycorrhizae formation on sagebrush roots on the site were much greater in 1997 than in 1985. Also, AM fungal spore density in 1997 was not significantly different in reclamation soil than in adjacent undisturbed native soil. These observations were interpreted as evidence that populations of AM fungi on the site are recovering and becoming more active as soil environmental conditions ameliorate.","Univ Wyoming, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Plant Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Univ Wyoming, Grad Sch, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Stahl, PD (reprint author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Renewable Resources, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",,,,,,,36,15,22,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,LONDON,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND",1532-4982,,,ARID LAND RES MANAG,Arid Land Res.

Decreasing soil water content results in an increase in the appearance of 'beam hardening'. Decreasing soil water content from 0.3 to 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) caused the transpiration rate to decrease by 6-10 times. This was presumably due to a reduction in the water potential gradient across the root membrane. The transpiration rate decreased less rapidly than did the water content at the soil-root interface, suggesting some osmotic adjustment by the leaves. This osmotic adjustment would allow the plant to maintain transpiration rate even at relatively low soil water content. The drawdown distances associated with roots growing at the lower soil water content were 8 times smaller than those at the high soil water content and the value of theta (v) at the soil-root interface at the end of the transpiration period was 2.5 times lower. The radish roots exhibited a temporary slight decrease in diameter after the transpiration commenced followed by a significant temporary increase. However, root diameter stabilised around its original value when the plant attained an almost steady water uptake rate. Despite the complexity arising from 'beam hardening', CAT scanning can provide valuable information on processes at the root-soil interface.","Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Aylmore, LAG (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Dept Soil Sci & Plant Nutr, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",,,,,,,25,18,18,0,10,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",Apr-73,,,AUST J SOIL RES,Aust.

The new species Tomentella subamyloidea is characterised by subglobose spores with evenly distributed echinuli and apiculi plugs that turn slightly bluish in Melzer's reagent. A slight amyloid reaction is also apparent in the walls of very thick-walled hyphae close to the substrate. Other significant characteristics include blue granules on subicular and subhymenial hyphae and on basidia and the lack of rhizomorphs. Tomentella radiosa has triangular, warty spores and uniform rhizomorphs with rather loosely arranged hyphae. A slight amyloidy is restricted to cap-like thickenings of the marginal subicular hyphae. Tomentella radiosa is closely related to the ectomycorrhizal species Tomentella sublilacina and the former may also form mycorrhizae as its fruitbodies occur on burnt woody debris at the soil surface. Tomentella subamyloidea has some anatomical features that can be regarded as plesiomorphic within the family Thelephoraceae, e.g. thin farinose fruitbodies, lack of rhizomorphs, consistent presence of clamps and lack of cystidia. In contrast, Tomentella radiosa has some anatomical features that can be regarded as being more advanced, e.g. the formation of rhizomorphs, simple in this species and distinctly lobed spores.","Univ Munich, Sect Mycol, Inst Systemat Bot, D-80638 Munich, Bayern, Germany; CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Wembly, WA 6913, Australia","Agerer, R (reprint author), Univ Munich, Sect Mycol, Inst Systemat Bot, Menzingerstr 67, D-80638 Munich, Bayern, Germany.",,,,,,,20,14,15,0,3,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1030-1887,,,AUST SYST BOT,Aust.

Two pathways connecting the below- and the aboveground community are distinguished: One functioning via soil animal-mediated changes in plant performance which in consequence affect herbivores and thereby the above-ground community; the second functioning via generalist predators which benefit from below-ground energy supply. The first pathway may be considered as bottom-up control of the above-ground community by belowground animals, the second functions by strengthening top-down forces above the ground when generalist predators switch their attacks from decomposers amongst herbivores. It is assumed that both pathways are of significant importance in many terrestrial systems, surprisingly, so far both are hardly investigated. It is stressed that in the plant pathway microbi-detririvores in soil like earthworms, collembolans and protozoans might be considerably more important than root herbivores which directly affect plant growth. The generalist predator pathway is considered to be particularly important in natural systems like grasslands, however, when employing intelligent management strategies which support microbi-detritivore populations and get generalist predators to switch prey from microbi-detritivores to herbivores this pathway may also help in controlling herbivore pest species in arable systems.","Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Scheu, S (reprint author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Zool, Schnittspahnstr 3, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.",,"Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015",,,,,120,167,172,3,74,URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"BRANCH OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, D-07705 JENA, GERMANY",1439-1791,,,BASIC APPL ECOL,Basic Appl.

This study was conducted to i) determine how soil-applied As affected the shoot and root dry weights, root length density, As uptake and tissue concentration, and total water use of canola and ii) evaluate the influence of soil As on phosphorus (P) uptake by and tissue concentration of canola seedlings. An experiment was conducted in a controlled-climate chamber using three soils with histories of cotton production (Commerce silt loam, Rilla silt loam, and Sterlington silt loam) and three As application rates (0, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1)). Four 14-day-old canola seedlings were planted three in soils with histories of cotton production (Commerce silt loam, Rilla silt loam, and Sterlington silt loam) and three As application rates (0,5, and 10 mg kg(-1)). Four 14-day-old canola seedlings were planted in 3-L pots containing 2.5 kg (oven-dry-weight basis) of each soil. After 14 days, whole plants were harvested. Shoot and root tissues were dried and analyzed for As and P. Arsenic uptake by seedlings grown in both the Commerce and Sterlington soils increased when 5 mg kg(-1) As were added, but did not increase with further As addition. In the Rilla soil, As uptake did not change with As addition, possibly due to the lack of change in soil solution As with As addition. Arsenic tended to remain in the roots, rather than being translocated to the shoots. Arsenic addition had no effect on shoot and root dry weights, root length density, or total plant water use in any of the soils; however, As toxicity symptoms were evident on leaves of plants in all treatments where As had been applied. Phosphorus uptake by the canola seedlings tended to decrease as soil As increased, but P concentration in tissue was not affected. A decrease in shoot P:As ratios in plants grownin Commerce and Sterlington soils indicated competition between these ions. Results of this study suggest that canola could be adversely affected if grown on soils with a fresh As application.","Mississippi State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Louisiana Agr Expt Stn, Dept Agron, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Cox, MS (reprint author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Box 9555, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",,,,,,,33,13,21,0,4,MARCEL DEKKER INC,NEW YORK,"270 MADISON AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

This unique characteristic is caused by dieback of exposed, windward plant tissues, growth of the plant to the leeward, and the ability of these plants to produce new roots from branches buried in organic debris. This mobility also allows for the study of tree-induced changes on properties of soils initially formed by tundra vegetation. Soil characteristics, root productivity, decomposition of litter, and nitrogen flux in soils beneath mobile tree islands and adjacent alpine meadow tundra were studied to test whether tree islands modify the physical and chemical properties of soils formed in alpine tundra. Rates of surface decomposition of a standardized litter substrate were significantly increased leeward of tree islands and significantly decreased within these islands. Soil pH was not significantly reduced by tree island passage. We found significant reductions in amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) and KCl-extractable NH4+ in soils influenced by tree islands. No recovery in soil organic matter or NH4+ was observed at locations that correspond to 250-500 yr since the passage of a tree island. Cation exchange capacity was correlated with percentage SOM but was not reduced by tree island passage. Soil texture differences, when present, did not support the hypothesis that surface soils lose clay content with tree island passage but were consistent with a reduction in the depth of the A horizon of these locations. The soil carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13) is only temporarily influenced by the passage of tree islands, suggesting that tree carbon is not stabilized in soils. Moreover while trees have numerous roots within the O horizon of soil, root ingrowth bags demonstrated large reductions in fine root production in the A horizons beneath trees (149 g.m(-2).yr-(1) in tundra vs. 25 g.m(-2).yr(-1) beneath trees). Resin bag nitrogen collections indicated that soils beneath trees had higher NH4+ losses than adjacent tundra soils. Tree island passage therefore reduced SOM and the nitrogen storage potential of former tundra soils, and these effects likely persist for centuries following the passage of a tree island.","Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Environm Populat & Organism Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Seastedt, TR (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,38,40,42,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",Dec-58,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,8,17,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0008:EOMTIO]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200002,,,,,10/31/19B,"Fitter, AH",,"Press, MC; Huntly, NJ; Levin, S",,"Fitter, AH",,,"Specificity, links and networks in the control of diversity in plant and microbial communities",ECOLOGY: ACHIEVEMENT AND CHALLENGE,,,English,Proceedings Paper,41st Symposium of the British-Ecological-Society,"APR 10-13, 2000","ORLANDO, FL","British Ecol Soc, Ecol Soc Amer",,,ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; HYACINTHOIDES NON-SCRIPTA; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; HOST-SPECIFICITY; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; PATHOGENIC FUNGI; SPATIAL PATTERNS; CARBON TRANSFER,,"Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Fitter, AH (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,84,24,24,0,4,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,0-632-05878-1,,,,2001,,,,,,,95,114,,,,,20,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BT45Q,WOS:000173048000005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Cermak, J; Kucera, J; Prax, A; Bednarova, E; Tatarinov, F; Nadyezhdin, V",,,,"Cermak, J; Kucera, J; Prax, A; Bednarova, E; Tatarinov, F; Nadyezhdin, V",,,Long-term course of transpiration in a floodplain forest in southern Moravia associated with changes of underground water table,EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA,,,English,Article,,,,,,transpiration; floodplain forests; underground water table; long-term changes; adaptation,TREES; SOIL; OAK; VELOCITY; SPRUCE; STANDS; PLANT; MODEL; ROOTS; FLOW,"Transpiration of fully grown floodplain forests growing on heavy alluvial soils in southern Moravia was studied during 10 years over the period of 27 years under changing environmental conditions;And impacts of water management measures. The study period characterized the situation under last regular floods in early seventies, about 20 year long transition period with no floods and decreased underground water table and several years long recent period, when water table increased again due to controlled watering. Transpiration was estimated through continuous sap now measurement over the whole growing seasons using stem segment heat balance method applied on a series of sample trees (mostly oaks, to much less extent also ash and lime). Floodplain forests growing under nonlimiting soil water supply and high evaporation demands transpired high amounts of water approaching up to about 80% of potential evapotranspiration. This amount was supplied up to 70% from underground water sources and 30% from precipitation. Lack of soil water as well as soil air supply limited transpiration, absorption of water decreased in locally long-term flooded trees. Water consumption of forests significantly decreased after water management measures, which led to decreasing underground weller table. Then only about 10% of transpired water were supplied from underground, the rest was dependent on local precipitation. Trees with unfavorable root/shoot ratio suffered relative drought due to insufficient hydraulic conductivity of slightly desiccated soil around orginally developed (during the flood period) small root systems as shown before. Such a situation can endanger functional stability of forests if dry year; would occur. Trees already adapted to changed water supply conditions during about 16 and more years, were able to absorb about 30% of water from underground sources for their transpiration. Studied floodplain forests are recently (24 years after cessation of floods) functionally adapted to changes of water supply and after period of increased danger of tree decline by drought have,low a better chance to survive. It can be expected that controlled periodical soil water anti air supply will further improve the situation, if already occurred adaptation of forests will be considered.","Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic","Cermak, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",,"Bednarova, Emilie/C-8065-2014; Kucera, Jiri/F-2022-2014",,,,,68,10,12,0,0,SLOVAK ACADEMIC PRESS LTD,BRATISLAVA,"PO BOX 57 NAM SLOBODY 6, 810 05 BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",1335-342X,,,EKOL BRATISLAVA,Ekol.

Yet little is known about the pattern of association between clonal plants and AM fungi. Here we report on the pattern of mycorrhizal association within the rhizome systems of mayapple, Podophyllum peltatum. Mayapple is a long-lived understory clonal herb that is classified as obligately mycorrhizal. We found that while all mayapple rhizome systems maintained mycorrhizal associations, the percent colonization of roots by AM fungi differed among ramets of different age. The highest concentrations of AM fungi were in the roots of intermediate-aged ramets, while roots beneath the youngest ramet were not colonized. This pattern of ramet age or position-dependent colonization was observed in two separate studies; each conducted in a different year and at a different site. The pattern of AM fungal colonization of mayapple rhizome systems suggests that the mycorrhizal relationship is facultative at the ramet level. This conclusion is reinforced by our observation that augmentation of soil phosphate lowers root colonization by AM fungi. We also found that soil phosphate concentrations were depleted by ca. 1% under the same ramet positions where roots bore the highest AM fungal loads. Three non-exclusive hypotheses are proposed regarding the mechanisms that might cause this developmentally dependent pattern of mycorrhizal association.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Watson, MA (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",mwatson@bio.indiana.edu,,,,,,60,7,7,1,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

The two equivalency factor methods are the Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity (PBT) method and the Multimedia Fate Modeling (MFM) method using a Mackay Level III model with state-specific environmental data. The simplified risk assessment (SRA) method involved dispersion modeling using site-specific environmental data. The life cycle inventory information evaluated by all three methods was limited to manufacturing of the RDX-based explosive in Kingsport, Tennessee. The effort to collect site-specific environmental data and conduct air dispersion modeling for the SRA method required about 24 times more effort than the PBT method and about 4 times more effort than the MFM method. Direct comparison of impact potential scores for the three approaches were limited to inhalation toxicity scores for nine air pollutants modeled by SRA. Correlations were made on the rank order of the impact potential scores for the nine air emissions evaluated for all three LCIA methods. Although the number of chemicals compared is very limited, the best correlation coefficient (0.96) was between the rank orders for the MFM and the SRA methods. The minimal effort and reduced accuracy of the PBT approach make it best suited for screening large numbers of chemicals for further evaluation of the highest ranked chemicals. The intermediate effort and reasonable accuracy (includes transfers to other media) of the MFM approach make it well suited for LCIAs involving comparative assertions or governmental policy decisions. The maximum effort and assumption of highest accuracy make the SRA approach suitable only after limiting the locations of interest to a few sites by screening with the other two approaches.","Battelle Mem Inst, Columbus, OH 43201 USA; Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Tolle, DA (reprint author), Battelle Mem Inst, 505 King Ave, Columbus, OH 43201 USA.",,,,,,,32,2,2,0,4,ECOMED PUBLISHERS,LANDSBERG,"RUDOLF-DIESEL-STR 3, D-86899 LANDSBERG, GERMANY",0948-3349,,,INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS,Int.

Growth records were extracted from tree rings in Guanacaste province, Costs Rica. These chronologies provide a long-term (c. 85-y) record of tree growth for two species with contrasting phenologies. Annual growth, in both species, was dependent on annual and/or monthly variation in local precipitation but less so on temperature. For each species, however, patterns of growth reflected unique degrees of sensitivity to monthly rainfall and rainfall during previous years. It is hypothesized that such differences were due to the rooting depth of these species. A review of the literature also indicated similar diverse cambial growth responses by tropical trees to variation in annual and monthly climate. Lastly, it was shown that variation in longer term fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as measured by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), significantly influenced local precipitation in Guanacaste only during the wettest portion of the wet season. Such temporal sensitivity may have differentially influenced the longer-term growth of some tropical tree species but not others. Together, these results support the hypothesis that tropical tree species respond individualistically to variation in local and regional climate and that some tropical assemblages may in fact be structured by species-specific differences in soil water-use.","Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93191 USA; Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Enquist, BJ (reprint author), Biosci W Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,"Enquist, Brian J./B-6436-2008","Enquist, Brian J./0000-0002-6124-7096",,,,93,74,82,1,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

Bacterial sulfate reduction was strongly affected by salinity and showed an optimum around 5-6% NaCl in the southern arm and an optimum of around 12% NaCl in the more hypersaline northern arm of the lake. High densities of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) ranging from 2.2 x 10(7) to 6.7 x 10(8) cells cm(-3) were determined by a newly developed tracer MPN-technique (T-MPN) employing sediment media and S-35-sulfate. Calculation of specific sulfate reduction rates yielded values comparable to those obtained in pure cultures of SRB. However, when using a conventional MPN technique with synthetic media containing high amounts of Fe(II), the numbers of SRB were underestimated by 1-4 orders of magnitude as compared to the T-MPN method. Our results suggest that high densities of slightly to moderately halophilic and extremely halotolerant SRB are responsible for the high rates of sulfate reduction measured in Great Salt Lake sediments.","Aarhus Univ, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Microbial Ecol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark","Ingvorsen, K (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Microbial Ecol, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",,"Ingvorsen, Kjeld/J-5290-2013; Brandt, Kristian Koefoed/I-3240-2012","Brandt, Kristian Koefoed/0000-0001-7886-9708",,,,40,68,70,0,13,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

There have been many past studies relating RMF's to the presence of free-water. Most of these studies were less than five years and mostly compared colors with chroma less than or equal to 2. This study will look at free-water occurrence related to RMF's with chroma less than or equal to 2, chroma. > 2, and Fe-Mn nodules. The objective of this research is to relate various RMF's of a fine-silty, siliceous, mesic Aquic Hapludult to the occurrence of free-water using eleven years data. Three sets of wells and piezometers were installed and each set contained one well and two piezometers from 53 to 175 cm deep for a total of nine sampling points. Within a well set, the wells were spaced 60 cm. apart and the sets were spaced from 6 to 18 m apart. This soil had three different types of RMF's: Fe-Mn nodules only, RMF's chroma > 2, and RMF's chroma less than or equal to 2 and were grouped accordingly to compare the percent occurrence of free-water. The Fe-Mn horizon had an average free-water occurrence of 5 +/- 4% of the observations. Horizons with RMF's chroma > 2 had an average of 16 +/- 6%. Finally, the horizons with RMF's chroma less than or equal to 2 had an average of 40 +/- 6% occurrence of free-water for eleven years data. These data suggest that any RMF should be considered to be an indicator of a seasonal water table, and the frequency and duration of the water table will be related to the intensity of the RMF that is expressed. These data showed that free-water occurred in all horizons which contained redoximorphic features. Although all or some of these RMF's could have formed under a different moisture regime, the frequency of free-water occurrence agrees well with the intensity of the RMF. This paper and other studies suggests that all redoximorphic features should be used to estimate soil hydrology for septic tank filter field design.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Owens, PR (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,AMER SOC AGR ENGINEERS,ST JOSEPH,"2950 NILES RD, ST JOSEPH, MI 49085-9659 USA",,,1-892769-18-2,,,,2001,,,,,,,87,96,,,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BU11N,WOS:000175044100010,,,,,10/31/19B,"Reneau, RB; Hagedorn, C; Jantrania, AR",,"Mancl, K",,"Reneau, RB; Hagedorn, C; Jantrania, AR",,,Performance evaluation of two pre-engineered onsite treatment and effluent dispersal technologies,"ON-SITE WASTEWATER TREATMENT, PROCEEDINGS",,,English,Proceedings Paper,9th National Symposium on Individual and Small Community Sewage Systems,"MAR 11-14, 2001","FT WORTH, TX",ASAE,,on-site systems; fecal coliforms; nitrogen; phosphorus; infiltration rate,,"Treatment of septic tank effluent (STE) or raw wastewater using a recirculating media filter (RMF) and an aerobic treatment unit (ATU), respectively, prior to subsurface dispersal has been shown to enhance the longevity of the dispersal system and ensure protection of ground and surface water. A field evaluation of pre-engineered RMF (three years) and ATU (two years) was conducted to determine the effluent quality produced by these systems. Effluent from the RMF (RMFE) was applied to field prototype trenches using a simulated low-pressure distribution (LPD) system while effluent from the ATU (ATUE) was applied to a raised filter bed (RFB), The LPD trenches were dosed with RMFE at rates of 2.13 and 4.26 ern d(-1) from 10/97 to 6/99 and at 4.26 and 10.65 cm d(-1) from 10/99 to 6/00 and STE at a rate of 2.13 cm d(-1), The RFB received ATUE generated from a single-family residence. Both the RMF and the ATU consistently produced a high quality effluent with >99.5% of the N being nitrified. The fecal coliform counts were <150 and <2000 counts 100 mL(-1) and the BOD5 concentrations were < 5 and <10 mg L-1 for the RMFE and ATUE, respectively. A coliphage study in the RMF showed that phage dieoff was complete after 12 h. In both the RFB and LPD dispersal systems there was limited movement of fecal coliforms. In the RFB, there was limited P transport and N decreased with distance from the effluent application area, with almost no detectable N being present at the end of the RFB. Nitrate (NO3)-N/Cl ratios indicated that NO3 disappearance was not a result of dilution and was attributed to denitrification. In the LPD trenches, the average NO3 concentrations were >1 I mg N L-1 at all sample points and P concentration increased with time. Infiltration rates in the prototype trenches have not decreased during the study where RMFE was applied at rates two and five times higher than the STE loading rate recommended in Virginia, This paper will present details of the study and complete analysis of the data along with the conclusions related to the effectiveness of pre-engineered treatment and effluent dispersal technologies for onsite systems.","Virginia Tech, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Reneau, RB (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,AMER SOC AGRICULTURAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERS,ST JOSEPH,"2950 NILES RD, ST JOSEPH, MI 49085-9659 USA",,,1-892769-18-2,,,,2001,,,,,,,271,280,,,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BU11N,WOS:000175044100029,,,,,10/31/19J,"Van der Heijden, EW; Kuyper, TW",,,,"Van der Heijden, EW; Kuyper, TW",,,Laboratory experiments imply the conditionality of mycorrhizal benefits for Salix repens: role of pH and nitrogen to phosphorus ratios,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhiza; conditionality; ectomycorrhiza; nitrogen-phosphorus ratio; pH; Salix repens,PINUS-SYLVESTRIS-L; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EXTRAMATRICAL MYCELIUM; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS; PAXILLUS-INVOLUTUS; EXCESS NITROGEN; GLOMUS-MOSSEAE; SOIL-PH; GROWTH; INFECTION,"Responses of one arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus mosseae) and two ectomycorrhizal fungi (Hebeloma leucosarx, Paxillus involutus) to a range of substrate conditions were investigated in the laboratory. Non-mycorrhizal controls were also included. Substrate conditions included three levels of nitrogen - phosphorus ratios, ranging from N limitation to P limitation (N/P ratio 5.4, 16.2, 48.6), and three pH's, ranging from acidic to alkaline (pH 4, 5.5, 7), in a full factorial experiment. Plant parameters (carbon gain, N and P-content, root length) were significantly affected by fungus, soil pH and soil N/P, and their interactions. Mycorrhizal benefits by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) were generally larger than by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), when assessed by above-ground parameters. Glomus mosseae, despite low colonization, had a much larger positive effect on root length than those EcMF. Hebeloma leucosarx and P. involutus were equally effective, despite differences in proportional colonization. Hebeloma leucosarx was able to expand niche width of S. repens towards alkaline conditions. Results are discussed in the framework of a dune successional gradient from young, calcareous, humus-poor towards old, acidic, humus-rich soils.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Environm Sci, Subdept Soil Qual, NL-6700 EC Wageningen, Netherlands","Van der Heijden, EW (reprint author), Bejo Zaden, Seed Technol Lab, POB 50, NL-1749 ZH Warmenhuizen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,45,34,34,0,20,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2001,228,2,,,,,275,290,,10.1023/A:1004850423794,,,16,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,398VG,WOS:000166776700012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Amsellem, L; Chevallier, MH; Hossaert-McKey, M",,,,"Amsellem, L; Chevallier, MH; Hossaert-McKey, M",,,Ploidy level of the invasive weed Rubus alceifolius (Rosaceae) in its native range and in areas of introduction,PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rubus alceifolius; Malachobatus; Indian Ocean islands; invasive species; weeds; ploidy level; chromosome counts; flow cytometry,NUCLEAR-DNA AMOUNTS; GENOME SIZE; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; MATURITY GROUP; PLANT; MUSA; ANGIOSPERMS; POLYPLOIDY; BIOLOGY; PISUM,"A change in ploidy level could increase invasiveness of introduced plants in insular plant communities.

The nuclear DNA content of other individuals from the native range and areas of introduction was estimated using the flow cytometry method. The Vietnamese individual on which chromosomes Were counted was added to the sample, to enable deduction of the ploidy level of all individuals from their nuclear DNA content. All individuals were found to be tetraploid, except 10 individuals from a single clone collected in a Vietnamese population, estimated to be triploid, and morphologically different of other individuals of this study.

The results showed: regarding Pinus halepensis plantations, one or two year old seedlings are recommended of good quality, 20-30 cm height, with rich and fine root system. Spartium junceum can be used either as containerized or as bare root seedlings and the seedlings must have at least 25 cm height. The parent material (bedrock) strongly affected the species survival having better results in schists comparing to the results in the granites. The protection from grazing is necessary at least for a period of 7 years after the plantations or for the period which the seedlings are in danger for survival. In no case soil compression and degradation should occur.","Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, Lab Silvicutlure, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece","Tsitsoni, TK (reprint author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, Lab Silvicutlure, POB 262, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece.",,,,,,,18,1,1,0,4,UNIV AEGEAN,ATHENS,"VOULGAROKTONOU 30, ATHENS 114 72, GREECE",,,,,,,2001,,,,,,,886,893,,,,,8,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BU36Q,WOS:000175780700114,,,,,10/31/19S,"Feller, C; Fink, M",,"Rahn, CR; Lillywhite, RD; DeNeve, S; Fink, M; Ramos, C",,"Feller, C; Fink, M",,,Root development of celery measured with minirhizotrons and core sampling,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH NITROGEN FERTILISATION OF FIELD GROWN VEGETABLE CROPS,ACTA HORTICULTURAE,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Conference on Environmental Problems Associated with Nitrogen Fertilisation of Field Grown Vegetable Crops,"AUG 30-SEP 01, 1999","POTSDAM, GERMANY",European Commiss,,minirhizotron; core sampling,,"In a field experiment, the temporal and spatial root development of rooted celery (Apium graveolens L. var. secalinum) was measured using two sampling methods (minirhizotrons and core sampling).

High intersection counts at harvest were measured to a depth of 15 cm and to a horizontal distance of 25 cm. A regression function was used to interpret the minirhizotron data. For each sampling date, this function was fitted to the number of observed intersections influenced by the depth and horizontal distance. Using the regression function, root length density measured by the core sampling method, was significantly correlated with the number of minirhizotron intersections calculated.","Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany","Feller, C (reprint author), Inst Vegetable & Ornamental Crops, Theodor Echtermeyer Weg 1, D-14979 Grossbeeren, Germany.",,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,90-6605-974-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2001,,563,,,,,247,252,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2001.563.31,,,6,Agronomy; Soil Science,Agriculture,BT57J,WOS:000173399100031,,,,,10/31/19B,"Hiremath, S; Podila, G",,,SAF; SAF,"Hiremath, S; Podila, G",,,Utilization of genetically engineered fungi for remedying adverse soil conditions,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS, 2001 NATIONAL CONVENTION",,,English,Proceedings Paper,National Convention of the Society-of-American-Foresters,"SEP 13-17, 2001","DENVER, CO",Soc Amer Foresters,,mycorrhizal fungi; genetic engineering; bioremediation,,,"USDA, NE Forest Expt Stn, Delaware, OH 43015 USA","Hiremath, S (reprint author), USDA, NE Forest Expt Stn, Delaware, OH 43015 USA.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,SOC AMER FORESTERS,WASHINGTON,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, WASHINGTON, DC 20014 USA",,,0-939970-83-X,,,,2001,,,,,,,397,397,,,,,1,Environmental Sciences; Forestry,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,BU77T,WOS:000176993900045,,,,,10/31/19B,"Rodrigues, LRD; Rodrigues, TDD; Ramos, AKB; De Quadros, DG",,"Gomide, JA; Mattos, WRS; DaSilva, SC",,"Rodrigues, LRD; Rodrigues, TDD; Ramos, AKB; De Quadros, DG",,,Dry matter production of shoots and root density of two cultivars of Lablab purpureus (L.)

In barley and chickpea growing in soils treated with insoluble phosphates and inoculated with strain PECA21 the phosphorous content was significantly increased in a 100 and 125%, respectively. Also, the dry matter, nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium content in both plants was significantly increased in inoculated soil added with insoluble phosphate. These results show that the inoculation of a soil with rhizobia should not be based only on the effectiveness of the strains with respect to their nitrogen fixation potential, since these microorganisms can increase the growth of plants by means of other mechanisms, for example the phosphate solubilization.

Whole cell protein profiles of the wild type in the presence of NaCl showed an overall increase in the levels of several proteins (22, 38, 68, >97 kDa), whereas in its exo- mutant, certain low molecular weight outer membrane proteins (38 and 22 kDa) decreased. Other outer membrane proteins (22, 38, 40, 42,62 and 68 kDa) also markedly decreased in both the wild type and the exo- mutant in the presence of salt. Similarly, both the wild type and the exo - mutant showed decreased levels of both the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components (LPS I and LPS II) in the presence of NaCl.

Selected isolates were tested for the ability to enhance aspen seedling growth in vitro. Over 50 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi occur with Populus tremuloides in this region, primarily basidiomycete fungi in the Agaricales. Almost one-third (30%) were ubiquitous with aspen and were found on all three soil types. Over one-third (37%) were restricted to the acidic, sandy soil of the smelter-impacted Butte-Anaconda area, revealing a subset of fungi that tolerate these conditions. Mycorrhizal fungi were screened for their ability to enhance aspen growth and establishment. Of nine selected isolates, all but one increased the biomass of aspen seedlings 2-4 times.

In all, 23 animals were radio-tracked at three-month intervals between February 1995 and May 1996. During November 1995 a low- intensity experimental fire burned the entire home range of most animals. The northern bettong appeared fairly catholic in choice of nest site, with a variety of nest locations and nesting materials used. Prior to the fire, nests were generally located in areas of dense cover, such as the skirts of grass trees (46%) or grass close to a log (29%). After fire removed most ground cover in the nesting areas of most animals, bettongs used remaining shelter such as boulder piles (45%), recently fallen trees (8%) and patches of unburnt vegetation (21%). Nest areas (10.1 ha) of males were significantly larger than those of females (5.4 ha). Home ranges of both sexes were large (59 ha) and most ranges lacked distinct core areas, suggesting that bettongs used all parts of their home ranges equally. High mean rates of nightly movement by the northern bettong indicated that large distances were moved within home ranges during nightly foraging. No significant fire-related changes were detected in home-range size, home-range location, nest-area location or mean rates of nightly movement, suggesting that the northern bettong is well adapted to the low- and medium-intensity fires that characterise its habitat.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Zool & Trop Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Vernes, K (reprint author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada.",,"Pope, Lisa C/A-7533-2011; Vernes, Karl/A-2925-2011; Management, Ecosystem/C-2259-2011","Pope, Lisa C/0000-0002-1791-3979; Vernes, Karl/0000-0003-1635-9950; ",,,,49,34,39,0,26,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

Legumes are unable to consistently recognize parasitic rhizobia that, once established inside plant cells, use plant resources for their own reproduction rather than for N(2) fixation. Evolution of parasitism in rhizobia, driven partly by competition among multiple rhizobial strains infecting the same plant, may be countered by postinfection legume sanctions. Both the biochemical options for rhizobial cheating and the evolutionary effect of legume sanctions depend on differences in rhizobial life history associated with nodule type. In legumes with determinate nodule growth, rhizobia typically retain the ability to reproduce after differentiating into N(2)-fixing bacteroids. Sanctions against individual bacteroids (e.g., acid hydrolases) would therefore select for cooperative rhizobia. In nodules with indeterminate growth, bacteroids generally lose the ability to reproduce, so legume sanctions against bacteroids would have no effect on rhizobial evolution. Whole-nodule sanctions (e.g., decreased nodule O(2) permeability) could be effective, via kin selection of undifferentiated rhizobia that persist in indeterminate nodules and replenish soil populations after nodule senescence. Mixed nodules could reduce the effectiveness of whole-nodule sanctions. The frequency of mixed nodules under field conditions is unknown.","Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Denison, RF (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rfdenison@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,82,208,216,4,118,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Two of the largest Tuscan forests of this species, the one of Vallombrosa and the other of Mount Amiata, are seriously affected by Heter obasidion annosum, a fungus causing root rot. However, in spite of the same provenance of firs and intersterile group of the fungus, the tree death is different at the two sites. In one case, firs quickly died standing, while in the other they were uprooted after a slow course of the illness. A study Nas conducted on the two localities to perceive the role of soil properties in this connection. In the light of our results, pedological conditions are important, negatively affecting the plants either ""directly"" - limiting deep rooting and preventing the trees to achieve sufficient anchorage in the ground - and ""indirectly"" - favouring the sp read and the virulence of H. annosum.","Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Suolo & Nutr Pianta, I-50144 Florence, Italy","Certini, G (reprint author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Sci Suolo & Nutr Pianta, Piazzale Cascine 28, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",,,,,,,25,8,8,0,0,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0015-8003,,,FORSTWISS CENTRALBL,Forstwiss.

Live fine root mass (LFR) showed less seasonal variation than dead fine root mass (DFR), which was correlated with seasonal changes in soil moisture and soil temperature. LFR mass increased significantly (by 86%) in the elevated CO2 treatment, with an increment of 37 g(dry weight) m(-2) above the control plots after two years of CO2 fumigation. There was no long-term increment in DFR associated with elevated CO2, but significant seasonal accumulations of DFR mass occurred during the summer of the second year of fumigation. Overall, root net primary production (RNPP) was not significantly different, but annual carbon inputs were 21.7 gC m(-2) y(-1) (68%) higher in the elevated CO2 treatment compared to controls. Specific root respiration was not altered by the CO2 treatment during most of the year; however, it was significantly higher by 21% and 13% in September 1997 and May 1998, respectively, in elevated CO2. We did not find statistically significant differences in the C/N ratio of the root tissue, root decomposition or phosphatase activity in soil and roots associated with the treatment. Our data show that the early response of a loblolly pine forest ecosystem subject to CO2 enrichment is an increase in its fine root population and a trend towards higher total RNPP after two years of CO2 fumigation.","Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Matamala, R (reprint author), Argonne Natl Lab, Div Environm Res, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",,,,,,,67,157,174,2,56,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We investigated the Cd acquisition of mobilizing plant species (L. albus and L. angustifolius cultivars) and Lolium multiflorum: as a non-mobilizing plant species. Two contrasting soils were utilized: an acid humic podzol and a calcareous loess subsoil. The Cd uptake into the shoots was 5 - 10 times higher in Lolium multiflorum compared with the of L. albus and L. angustifolius. There are several reasons for this result: (i) The root length/shoot weight ratio was 2-3 times higher in ryegrass compared with the lupin cultivars, (ii) the translocation of Cd from the root into the shoot is higher in ryegrass compared with lupin, (iii) the Cd uptake is lower in lupin than in ryegrass in the humic podzol and at P deficiency also in the loess soil. In the acid podzol, the Cd concentration of the soil solution under lupin was lower than the control (pots without plants), whereas in the calcareous soil, the reverse relation was found. In white and clue lupin the carboxylate afflux, mainly citrate and malate was by a factor of 10-100 higher than in ryegrass. This can lead to a high rate of complexation of Cd by citrate (similar to 85%) in the rhizosphere soil solution of lupin. These results seem to support the hypothesis that the Cd uptake of the root is restricted by the complexation of Cd by citrate.","Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Chem, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Romer, W (reprint author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Agr Chem, Von Siebold Str 6, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",uaac@gwdg.de,,,,,,30,25,29,0,3,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

It is only recently that their ability to form ectomycorrhizas (EM) has been realized, so their distribution, abundance and significance as mycobionts in forest ecosystems is still largely unexplored. In order to provide baseline data for future ecological studies of tomentelloid fungi, we explored their presence and abundance in nine Swedish boreal forests in which the EM communities had been analysed. Phylogenetic analyses were used to compare the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) sequence data obtained from mycobionts on single ectomycorrhizal tips with that obtained from sporocarps of identified tomentelloid fungi. Five species of Tomentella and one species of Pseudotomentella were identified as ectomycorrhizal fungi The symbiotic nature of Tomentella bryophila, T. stuposa, T. badia and T. atramentaria is demonstrated for the first time. T. stuposa and Pseudotomentella tristis were the most commonly encountered tomentelloid fungi, with the other species, including T. sublilacina, only being recorded from single stands. Overall, tomentelloid fungi were found in five of the studies, colonizing between 1 and 8% of the mycorrhizal root tips. Two of the five sites supported several tomentelloid species. Tomentelloid fungi appear to be relatively common ectomycorrhizal symbionts with a wide distribution in Swedish coniferous forests. The results are in accordance with accumulating data that fungal species which lack conspicuous sporocarps may be of considerable importance in EM communities.","Estonian Agr Univ, Inst Zool & Bot, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, Tartu, Estonia; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Gothenburg, Inst Bot, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden","Koljalg, U (reprint author), Estonian Agr Univ, Inst Zool & Bot, 181 Riia St, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",,"Stenlid, Jan/K-5909-2019","Stenlid, Jan/0000-0002-5344-2094",,,,59,135,146,0,35,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) cultivars, wild type Bragg (nod(+), fix(+)) and its nitrate tolerant, hypernodulating mutant nts1116 (nod(++), fix+) were used for this experiment. These soybean plants were inoculated with a slow-growing rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 or fast-growing rhizobia consisting of a mixture of R. fredii USDA191, USDA193, and USDA194 and grown in a phytotron under natural light and controlled temperature conditions. Xylem sap was collected from Bragg and nts1116 plants at the flowering and pod elongation stages. Acetylene reduction activity per plant or per nodule weight was not different between soybean lines and inoculums. The composition of the nitrogenous compounds in the xylem sap was compared between the symbionts, with B. japonicum and R. fredii. At the flowering stage, ureide-N and amide-N accounted for 53 to 70% and 20 to 27% respectively of the total N in the sap collected from the plants inoculated either with B. japonicum or R. fredii. At the pod elongation stage, ureide-N and amide-N accounted for 74 to 85%, and 7 to 19% of total sap N. With the growth of the soybean plants, the ratio of ureide-N in the xylem sap increased. These results suggest that in the case of wild soybean and the hypernodulating mutant line nodulated by R. fredii, ureide is transported as the main nitrogenous compound of fixed nitrogen in the xylem sap in the same way as in plants nodulated with B. japonicum.","Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Plant Resources, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Yamakawa, T (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Dept Plant Resources, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",,,,,,,21,4,4,0,1,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Previous studies investigated the effects of these factors individually or in some combinations, but not their integrated effects at regional and global scales. This study describes an Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem C-budget model (InTEC), which integrates effects of all these factors on the annual C cycle of a forest region. InTEC is based on the Farquhar's leaf photosynthesis model, the Century C cycle model, the net N mineralization model of Townsend et al. [Ecol. Appl., 6 (1996) 806] and an age-NPP relationship derived from forestry inventory-based age-biomass relationships. To integrate these existing models, which were developed for different purposes and had different spatial and temporal scales, into a coherent mechanistic model, we (1) develop a spatial and temporal up-scaling algorithm to use the instantaneous leaf-level model for a region at annual time step; and then (2) combine the upscaled results with an age-NPP relationship to obtain the annual NPP of a forest region. A historical change approach is then used to describe the regional annual C cycle, which not only improves the accuracy of its historical and present estimates, but also enables us to predict its future responses, both of which are critical in formulating mitigation and adaptation strategies for global changes. Applying InTEC to Canada's forests, we first investigate the impacts of each factor on the C cycle over the short term (i.e. in the year of perturbation) and the long term (i.e. in the years after perturbation). The short-term and long-term effects are determined by changing one of the 10 factors in year 1 since the industrialization while keeping this factor in all other years and all other factors in all years at pre-industrial levels. Integrating all these short-term and long-term effects for the actual historical data of the 10 external forcing factors, we then estimate that the annual mean NBP (= NPP - soil respiration - fire emission - forest praoducts oxidation) of Canada's forests was 40 +/- 20 Tg C per year (i.e. a sink) in 1810s, reduced to - 131 +/- 66 Tg C per year (i.e. a source) in 1870s, increased thereafter to a maximum of 200 +/- 100 Tg C per year in 1930s, and decreased again to 57 +/- 27 Tg C per year in 1990s. From 1800 to 1998, the aboveground biomass of Canada's forests increased by similar to 19%, while the soil C stock increased by similar to 2%. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The growth and survival of herbivores which feed on plants could, as a consequence, also be affected by these mutualistic soil fungi. Consequently, interactions between AMF, plants and herbivores could occur. To test this, larvae of the common blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus (Lycaenidae), were fed with sprigs of Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) plants which were inoculated with one of two different AMF species, with a mixture of these AMF species or with sprigs of plants which were not inoculated with AMF Survival and larval weight of third instar larvae fed with plants colonised by AMF were greater than those of larvae fed with non-mycorrhizal plants. Survival of larvae feeding on non-mycorrhizal plants was 1.6 times lower than that of larvae feeding on plants inoculated with a mixture of AMF species and 3.8 times lower than that of larvae feeding on plants inoculated with single AMF species. Furthermore, larvae fed with non-mycorrhizal plants attained only about half the weight of larvae fed with mycorrhizal plants after 11 days of growth. These differences in larval performance might be explained by differences in leaf chemistry, since mycorrhizal plants had a 3 times higher leaf P concentration and a higher C/N-ratio. Our results, thus, show that the presence of belowground mutualistic soil fungi influences the performance of aboveground herbivores by altering their food quality. Larval consumption, larval food use and adult lipid concentrations of the common blue butterfly differed between larvae which were fed with plants inoculated with different AMF species. This suggests that the performance of herbivores is not only influenced by the presence of AMF but also depends on the identity of the AMF species colonising the host plants. Moreover, a significant interaction term between AMF species and maternal identity of the larvae occurred for adult dry weight, indicating that the performance of offspring from different females was differently influenced by AMF species composition. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time that the species composition of AMF communities can influence life-history traits of butterfly larvae and possibly herbivores in general.","Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Conservat Biol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Plant Physiol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Goverde, M (reprint author), Univ Basel, Dept Integrat Biol, Sect Conservat Biol, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",goverde@mail.com,"van der Heijden, Marcel G.A./H-5243-2011; Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",,,,53,93,104,3,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2000,125,3,,,,,362,369,,10.1007/s004420000465,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,376DJ,WOS:000165442700007,28547331,,,,10/31/19J,"Volk, M; Niklaus, PA; Korner, C",,,,"Volk, M; Niklaus, PA; Korner, C",,,Soil moisture effects determine CO2 responses of grassland species,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bromus; Carer; elevated carbon dioxide; functional growth analysis; water relations,ELEVATED CARBON-DIOXIDE; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE ECOSYSTEM; CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; WATER-USE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; GROWTH-RESPONSE; LEAF-AREA,"It has been suggested that positive biomass responses of grassland to elevated CO2 result from moisture savings in the soil as opposed to direct photosynthetic stimulation. In order to test this hypothesis for calcareous grassland we subjected experimental communities consisting of two important graminoid components of such grasslands (Carex flacca and Bromus erectus) on natural substrate to a fully factorial treatment of ambient (360 ppm) and elevated (600 ppm) CO2 concentration and four irrigation regimes (9 mm, 18 mm, 27 mm and 36 mm week(-1)). Biomass stimulation under elevated CO2 was higher the lower the irrigation rate was. Superimposed on the effects of irrigation on soil moisture, elevated CO2-induced higher soil water contents in all irrigation treatments via reduced plant water consumption (on average one-third lower stomatal conductance). This led to eight different soil moisture regimes instead of the intended four. When growth parameters were plotted against the effective soil water content rather than irrigation treatment, the ""pure"" CO2 effect on total biomass and other traits became much smaller and completely disappeared for biomass per tiller, leaf area per ground area, leaf mass fraction (LMF) and root mass fraction (RMF). We conclude that the CO2 response observed in this graminoid system consisted of a small primary CO2 effect and a large secondary, CO2-induced, soil moisture effect. Thus, it is difficult to use responses to CO2 from experiments in which CO2-induced soil moisture savings occur to predict CO2 effects as long as future soil moisture regimes are not defined. We suggest that direct and indirect (moisture driven) CO2 effects should be strictly separated, which requires data to be tested against soil moisture.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Volk, M (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",,"Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014","Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; ",,,,53,90,100,1,34,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2000,125,3,,,,,380,388,,10.1007/s004420000454,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,376DJ,WOS:000165442700009,28547333,,,,10/31/19J,"Zou, C; Sands, R; Sun, OB",,,,"Zou, C; Sands, R; Sun, OB",,,Physiological responses of radiata pine roots to soil strength and soil water deficit,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,osmotic adjustment; Pinus radiata; root elongation rate; turgor pressure; yield turgor,LUPIN ROOTS; TURGOR; GROWTH; RESISTANCE; LEAVES; CELLS,"We investigated physiological responses of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.

The two subspecies of northern flying squirrels that occur in the southern Appalachians, G. s. coloratus and G. s. fuscus, are endangered species which are primarily found in the ecotone between high-elevation spruce-fir and northern hardwood forests. Our objective was to determine the microhabitat and macrohabitat characteristics associated with the presence and abundance of truffles in suitable habitat for northern flying squirrels. We sampled for truffles in 24-26, 1-m(2) plots on each of 10 northern flying squirrel sites in North Carolina and measured micro- and macrohabitat characteristics associated with sample plots and sites. Elaphomyces granulatus was the most common species of truffle found (78.7%). Red spruce (Picea rubra) was significantly more likely to be one of the three closest trees to plots with truffles. Further, spruce was the most important species in plots with truffles, followed by beech (Fagus grandifolia), red oak (Quercus rubra) and yellow birch (Betula lutea), whereas the most important species in plots with no truffles were beech, followed by yellow birch, spruce and red oak. At the macrohabitat (site) level, spruce was the most important species in sites with high truffle production followed by beech and red oak, whereas the most important species in sites with low truffle production were beech, yellow birch, spruce and rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.). Significant variables entered into a linear regression model predicting the number of truffles in a site were the importance Values of fir (Abies fraseri), spruce and silverbell (Halesia carolina). Our data suggest that spruce-fir or mixed spruce-fir/hardwood stands are important foraging sites for northern flying squirrels in the southern Appalachians.","Clemson Univ, Dept Forest Resources, USDA, Forest Serv,So Res Stn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Loeb, SC (reprint author), Clemson Univ, Dept Forest Resources, USDA, Forest Serv,So Res Stn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",,,,,,,41,39,41,0,16,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The effects were evaluated on alfalfa plants grown in: (a) loamy chernozem control soil including the original rhizosphere community (bacteria+AMF); (b) gamma-sterilised soil (no microbes); (c) bacterial re-inoculated AMF-free soil (only bacteria). In these substrates the plants were inoculated with AMF (Glomus fasciculatum M107), with and without co-inoculation with the associative (Azospirillum brasilense Km5) and/or the symbiotic (Rhizobium meliloti Lu41+S5/7+K4/1) nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The Chi a fluorescence transients were recorded in vivo and analysed according to the JIP-test leading to the calculation of a constellation of parameters quantifying the photosystem II (PSII) behaviour. The beneficial effect of AMF is clearly revealed by the observed enhancement of the electron transport activity per leaf area. Based on the same criterion, an antagonism by both bacteria was detected. The antagonistic effect of Azospirillum was more pronounced than that of Rhizobium, though not strong enough to fully counter-balance for the beneficial effect of AMF. However, in the case of co-inoculation with both diazotrophs and AMF the electron transport activity was found to be only slightly lower than in the case of single inoculation by AMF, indicating that, in the presence of each other, the diazotrophs are no longer antagonistic to AMF. It was further clarified that these antagonistic effects are the net result of different synergistic and antagonistic effects, as follows: (a) Concerning the electron transport activity per absorption, Rhizobium has a synergistic effect on AMF's beneficial role, which is even more pronounced in the case of the tripartite co-inoculation, though Azospirillum in the absence of Rhizobium is antagonistic to AMF. (b) Concerning absorption per leaf, the beneficial influence of AMF is almost fully counterbalanced by co-inoculation with each of the diazotrophs or by both of them. The results demonstrate that the different combinations of inoculations and/or soils can be well distinguished by means of the JIP-test parameters and they thus suggest that the test can be used to screen, through the PSII behaviour of the plants, the effect of the microbial activity in the field. Two-dimensional rankings of the several soil/microbe combinations, in respect to the values of different energy fluxes, are shown to provide mappings that can be useful for the comparison of whole ecosystems or of individuals within an ecosystem.

Inoculation of potato plaits with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi eliminated this delay in G. pallida hatch, so that the two potato cyst nematode (PCN) species exhibited similar in-soil hatch rates. When the corresponding in vitro hatching activities of root leachate from uninoculated and mycorrhiza-inoculated plants were compared, similar effects were revealed. G. pallida hatch in root leachates from uninoculated plants increased significantly from one-week-old to two-week-old plants, but this increase was not significant in the mycorrhizal-inoculated plants. When the in-soil experiment was repeated using the potato cyst nematode non-host plant strawberry, mycorrhizal inoculation induced no significant increase in G. pallida hatch.

LIDET is a reciprocal litterbag study involving the transplanting of litter from 27 species across 28 sites in North and Central America reflecting a wide variety of natural and managed ecosystems and climates, from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforest. After 5 years, estimated k-values ranged from 0.032 to 3.734, lengths of Phase I (to 20% mass remaining) from 0.49 to 47.92 years, and fractional mass remaining from 0 to 0.81. Pine litter decomposed more slowly than Drypetes litter, supporting the notion of strong control of substrate quality over decomposition rates. Climate exerted strong and consistent effects on decomposition. Neither mean annual temperature or precipitation alone explained the global pattern of decomposition; variables including both moisture availability and temperature (i.e. actual evapotranspiration and DEFAC from the CENTURY model) were generally more robust than single variables. Across the LIDET range, decomposition of fine roots exhibited a Q(10) of 2 and was more predictable than that of leaves, which had a higher Q(10) and greater variability. Roots generally decomposed more slowly than leaves, regardless of genus, but the ratio of above- to belowground decomposition rates differed sharply across ecosystem types. Finally, Drypetes litter decomposed much more rapidly than pine litter in 'broadleaved habitats' than in 'conifer habitats', evidence for a 'home-field advantage' for this litter. These results collectively suggest that relatively simple models can predict decomposition based on litter quality and regional climate, but that ecosystem-specific problems may add complications.","Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; Oregon State Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, Forestry Sci Lab, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resources Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Gholz, HL (reprint author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,"Wedin, David A/K-4093-2012",,,,,42,460,514,9,261,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Conversely, defoliation, which decreases the plant's capacity to assimilate carbon, is predicted to increase allocation to shoot. We tested these RSB predictions, and whether responses to CO2 enrichment were modified by defoliation, using Heterotheca subaxillaris, an annual plant native to south-eastern USA. Plants were grown under near-ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and enriched (700 mu mol mol(-1)) levels of atmospheric CO2. Defoliation consisted of the weekly removal of 25% of each new fully expanded, but not previously defoliated, leaf from either rosette or bolted plants. In addition to dry mass measurements of leaves, stems, and roots, Kjeldahl N, protein, starch and soluble sugars were analysed in these plant components to test the hypothesis that changes in C:N uptake ratio drive shifts in root:shoot ratio. Young, rapidly growing CO2-enriched plants conformed to the predictions of RSB, with higher root:shoot ratio than ambient-grown plants (P < 0.02), whereas older, slower growing plants did not show a CO2 effect on root:shoot ratio. Defoliation resulted in smaller plants, among which both root and shoot biomass were reduced, irrespective of CO2 treatment (P < 0.03). However, H. subaxillaris plants were able to compensate for leaf area removal through flexible shoot allocation to more leaves vs. stem (P < 0.01). Increased carbon availability through CO2 enrichment did not enhance the response to defoliation, apparently because of complete growth compensation for defoliation, even under ambient conditions. CO2-enriched plants had higher rates of photosynthesis (P < 0.0001), but this did not translate into increased final biomass accumulation. On the other hand, earlier and more abundant yield of flower biomass was an important consequence of growth under CO2 enrichment.","Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Johnson, SL (reprint author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 60, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",,,,,,,52,9,10,0,6,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, it is not known how rhizobia benefit from nodulation of legume hosts because they fix nitrogen only after differentiating into bacteroids, terminally differentiated cells that cannot reproduce. Because free-living rhizobia can reproduce, and may benefit from the increase of plant root exudates stimulated by nodulation, evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation may depend upon kin selection. However, unrelated nonmutualists may also benefit from increased plant exudates and nitrogen-fixing populations are therefore vulnerable to invasion by nonfixing, saprophytic Rhizobium. The access of nonfixing Rhizobium to the plant exudates associated with nodules depends upon the spatial structure of the Rhizobium populations within the soil. We investigate the influence of spatial structure on the evolution of N-fixation within a Rhizobium population using a mathematical model. Our model demonstrates that spatial structure is necessary for the evolution of N-fixation and that N-fixation is more likely to evolve with increasing degrees of spatial structure. In fact, we identify three dynamic outcomes that depend upon the relative strength of the costs of N-fixation relative to the degree of spatial structure and benefits resulting from nodulations. If the costs are relatively high, N-fixation will not evolve; if the costs are relatively low, N-fixing genes will fix in the population, but at intermediate conditions, a stable mixture of N-fixing bacteria and nonfixing bacteria will be maintained. The conditions for coexistence of N-fixing bacteria and nonfixing bacteria expand under a saturating relationship between nodule numbers and N-fixing genotype frequency.","Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,34,41,47,0,26,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0018-067X,,,HEREDITY,Heredity,OCT,2000,85,4,,,,,366,372,,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00772.x,,,7,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,379VJ,WOS:000165663600007,11122414,Bronze,,,10/31/19J,"Kappen, L; Schultz, G; Gruler, T; Widmoser, P",,,,"Kappen, L; Schultz, G; Gruler, T; Widmoser, P",,,Effects of N-fertilization on shoots and roots of rape (Brassica napus L.) and consequences for the soil matric potential,JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,rape; soil tillage; N-fertilization; plant surface area; transpiration; root length density; soil matric potential; saisonality,OILSEED RAPE; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; GROWTH; NITROGEN; TRANSPIRATION; OAT,"The underlying question of these investigations asked, how and to which extent rape plants react with transpiration and soil water uptake to different degrees of nitrogen fertilization. Therefore repeated campaigns with concurrent measurements of plant surfaces (leaves, stems, pods), diurnal courses of leaf transpiration and root length density of rape plants growing on heavily (240 kg ha(-1)), moderately, (120 kg ha(-1)), and nil N-fertilized plots of an experimental field in northern Germany were performed during two growing seasons. Additionally, matric potentials at different soil depths were measured. In the first year (1994) investigations were concentrated primarily on shoot area development and transpiration, whereas in the subsequent year (1995) root measurements were mainly undertaken. Also, the influence of soil management (ploughing, conservation tillage) was taken into consideration. The plots where the shoot measurements were carried out were ploughed in 1994 and rotovated in 1995. Matric potentials were measured in both years in ploughed soil and, for comparison, also in soils with conservation tillage. Shoot area index, as measure of the transpiratory capacity of the canopy, increased on ploughed soil and reached a maximum before flowering. Thereafter it decreased until harvest when the relative amount of green stems and pods was increasing. Then, the measured transpiration rate per pod surface area was equal to, or higher than, the transpiration rate per leaf surface area. Plant surface area was smaller in plots with conservation tillage and decreased generally with decreasing N-fertilization. Increasing plant surface area was joined by an increasing density of plant canopy. Light interception was thus highest in the plots receiving 240 kg N ha(-1). Although the shading effect may cause a reduction of transpiration per plant, the total plant mass per area generally resulted in a greater water loss from these plots. Roots reached at least 110 cm depth. Root length density was significantly higher in the upper 10-30 cm of soil than at greater depths. Root mass was smaller in soil with conservation tillage than in ploughed soil. Oscillations of soil matric potentials in the diurnal and long-term periods were highest in the upper 10 cm of soil. Here, they corresponded well with the cumulative diurnal transpiratory water loss. It is concluded that the soil water dynamics depends largely on the distribution of plant roots. As a result, rape plants did not change their specific transpiration capacity as a response to increased nitrogen fertilization. However, the transpiring plant surface and root length density increased the turnover rate of water by a higher plant density per plot. This effect was more pronounced in ploughed than in rotovated plots.","Univ Kiel, Inst Bot, Lehrstuhl Okophysiol, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; Univ Kiel, Inst Wasserwirtsch & Landschaftsokol, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Kappen, L (reprint author), Univ Kiel, Inst Bot, Lehrstuhl Okophysiol, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",lkappen@bot.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,30,6,6,0,9,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

The mycorrhizal formation of trees can be affected by fertilizer applications, however, very little is known on such effects in arable soils. The effects of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization on mycorrhizal formation of two poplar clones (Populus trichocarpa and P. tremula x tremuloides) were investigated at the plantation Abbachhof (South Germany). We determined the ectomycorrhizal colonization and the abundance of VAM spores in the soil during three years, and the species richness of sporocarps during one growing season. Approximately 26 to 73% of the fine roots of P. trichocarpa and 41 to 82% of the fine roots of P. tremula x tremuloides were colonized with ectomycorrhizal fungi. The percentage of ectomycorrizal colonization on P. tremula x tremuloides was significantly reduced after both fertilization treatments. On P. trichocarpa only the P-fertilization reduced the ectomycorrhizal colonization. The composition of ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was significantly affected by the N and P fertilization on P. tremula x tremuloides, but not on P. trichocarpa. Sporocarps of 12 ectomycorrhizal fungi species were found at the plantation. Cortinarius uliginosus, Lactarius controversus and Krombholziella aurantiaca produced sporocarps only on control plots, whereas Cortinarius croceocaeruleus, Inocybe umbrina, Laccaria tortilis, Paxillus involutus and Rhizopogon roseolus produced sporocarps only on fertilized plots. Inocybe geophylla, I. glabripes, Laccaria laccata and Tuber borchii produced sporocarps on both control and fertilized plots. The density of VAM spores was lower in the rooting zone of Populus trichocarpa than under P. tremula x tremuloides. In an efficient management of these short rotation plantations mineral fertilizer applications must be low enough to avoid undesired suppressions of mycorrhizal formation.","Univ Rostock, Inst Soil Sci, D-18051 Rostock, Germany; Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Soil Sci, D-01735 Tharandt, Germany","Baum, C (reprint author), Univ Rostock, Inst Soil Sci, Justus von Liebig Weg 6, D-18051 Rostock, Germany.",christel.baum@agrarfak.uni-rostock.de,,"Baum, Christel/0000-0003-1179-2149",,,,42,56,58,0,38,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

Identification is achieved by comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat, derived from below-ground plant material, with a reference ITS region database for plants at a site. The method works throughout plants because the plant ITS region can be PCR amplified using a set of universal primers. Congeneric species can usually be identified because the ITS region evolves relatively rapidly. In our study, all roots were easily identified to the level of genus; most congeneric species were identified solely by ITS sequence differences but some required a combination of ITS sequence data and above-ground surveys of species at a site. In addition to showing the feasibility and efficacy of our technique, we compare it with another DNA-based technique used to identify belowground plant parts. Finally, we also describe a DNA extraction and purification technique that reliably provides high-quality DNA of sufficient quantity from roots so that PCR can be readily accomplished. Our technique should allow the below-ground parts of plants in any system to be identified and thereby open new possibilities for the study of below-ground plant communities.","Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Linder, CR (reprint author), Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,50,61,65,1,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

We revisited the 27 grassland and Forest field-layer communities, studied earlier by Zobel and Liira, to sample root biomass, plant total biomass and root/shoot allocation, and learn how the incorporation of below-ground biomass data would affect the shape of the hump-backed relationship. In order to avoid scaling artefacts we estimated richness as the average count of species per 500 plant ramets (absolute richness). We also included relative richness measures. Relative richness was defined as richness per 500 ramets/size of the actual species pool (the set of species present in the community), relative pool size was defined as size of the actual species pool/size of the regional species pool (the set of species available in the region and capable of growing in the given community). The biomass-absolute richness relationship was humped, irrespective of the biomass measure used, the hump being most obvious when plant total biomass was used as the independent variable. Evidently, the unimodal richness-productivity curve is not a sampling artefact, as suspected by Oksanen. However, relative richness was not related to community biomass (above-ground. below-ground or total). The humpbacked curve is shaped by the sizes of actual species pools in communities, implying that processes which are responsible for small-scale diversity pattern mainly operate on the community level. Neither absolute nor relative richness were significantly related to root/shoot allocation. The presumably stronger (asymmetric) shoot competition at greater allocation to shoots appears not to suppress small-scale richness. However: there is a significant relationship between relative pool size and root,shoot allocation. Relatively more species From regional species pools are able to enter and persist in communities with more biomass allocated into roots.","Univ Tartu, Dept Bot & Ecol, EE-2400 Tartu, Estonia","Liira, J (reprint author), Univ Tartu, Dept Bot & Ecol, 40 Lai St, EE-2400 Tartu, Estonia.",,"Zobel, Kristjan/F-2003-2011; Liira, Jaan/G-9879-2015","Liira, Jaan/0000-0001-8863-0098",,,,35,28,30,2,23,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2000,91,1,,,,,109,114,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910109.x,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,372ML,WOS:000165237400009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Buchmann, N",,,,"Buchmann, N",,,Biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil respiration rates in Picea abies stands,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,microbial respiration; organic layer; root respiration; seasonality; soil; respiration; Q(10) value,BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION; MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST; ROOT RESPIRATION; DECIDUOUS FOREST; CO2 EFFLUX; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; MICROBIAL RESPIRATION; EDDY-CORRELATION; DIOXIDE FLUXES; CONIFER FOREST,"The response of soil respiration to varying environmental factors was studied in four Picea abies stands (47-, 87-, 111- and 146-year old) during the 1998 growing season. While within-site Variations of soil CO2 efflux (up to 1.6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) were larger than their diurnal variability (<0.25 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), spatial variations within a site were smaller than seasonal changes in soil respiration rates (up to 4.4 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). Highest within-site variability of soil efflux was generally found during the summer months when maximum flux rates of 4-6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) were reached (coefficient of variation 40%). Soil temperatures (in the O-f and O-h layers, and A(h) horizon) showed a pronounced seasonal course, in contrast to soil moisture. An exponential equation best described the relationships between soil temperature in the Of layer and soil CO2 efflux (r(2) between 0.75 and 0.81). However, an Arrhenius type equation always resulted in lower r(2) values (0.52-0.71). The Q(10) values ranged between 2.39 (146-year old stand) and 3.22 (87-year old stand), averaging 2.72 for the P. abies stands within the watershed. The removal of litter and organic layers generally affected soil CO2 efflux negatively. In three of the four P. abies stands (47-, 87-, 146-year old stands), soil respiration rates were reduced by 10-20% after removal of the L and O-f layer, and by 30-40% after removal of the L and most of the O-f and O-h layers. Thus, mineral soil respiration seemed to contribute a major fraction to the total soil CO2 flux (> 60%). Trenching shallow fine roots during collar insertion and mechanical inhibition of root in-growth during the following months allowed fine root respiration to be separated from microbial respiration only in times of highest root growth. Microbial respiration seemed to dominate the respiratory CO2 loss from the forest floor (>70%). The comparison of the annual soil CO2 efflux in the 47-year old P. abies stand (about 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) with annual litterfall and root net primary productivity estimates supported this conclusion.

The forests have received chronic-N fertilization at three different rates (0, 50, 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) since 1988. Both BDOC concentration and %BDOC [% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] were significantly higher in the summer (18-20 mg C l(-1), approximate to 30%) than spring or fall for both forest types. The BDOC depletion that was hypothesized to occur with chronic-N application and N saturation was not found in either stand. Instead, for the hardwood stand, BDOC concentration increased with N application, probably due to increased BDOC production in the forest floor with increases in available N. The strong negative relationship between litterfall mass and both BDOC concentration (r(2) = 0.36) and %BDOC (r(2) = 0.60) for the hardwood stand suggests that the primary source of BDOC in the hardwood forest floor is recent photosynthate allocated to fine roots for their growth, and organic compounds released from them (e.g., exudates and mucilage) rather than the leachate of freshly fallen autumn litter. A significant but weaker positive relationship between BDOC and ambient temperature for both stands suggests that the decomposition of forest floor organic matter is an additional source of BDOC in the forest floor. The production of non-biodegradable DOC (NBDOC) in the forest floor was not sensitive to ambient temperature or the chronic-N treatment. This suggests that an abiotic process, such as chemical equilibration between forest floor and forest floor solution, is responsible for the concentration of non-labile DOG. High %BDOC in throughfall (50-75%) for both stands suggests that throughfall is possibly an additional source of BDOC in the forest floor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Well-irrigated plants tended to develop greater individual leaf area, number of leaves per plant, total plant leaf area, height and root:shoot ratios than water-stressed plants, but the difference between treatments was not significant for any parameter in any species. Quercus macrolepis appeared to be the most drought-tolerant of the four species. It maintained the highest number of leaves of the smallest size and increased the proportion of fine roots during drought. In all species, drought caused significant decreases in stomatal conductance and predawn and midday water potentials from mid-July until the end of August, when the lowest soil water content and highest mean daily air temperatures and midday leaf temperatures occurred; however, the responses were species-specific. Among the four species, Quercus macrolepis sustained the highest stomatal conductance despite very low water potentials, thus overcoming drought by means of desiccation tolerance. Quercus ilex decreased stomatal conductance even before severe water stress occurred, thereby avoiding dessication during drought. Quercus pubescens had the highest water potential despite a high stomatal conductance, indicating that its leaf water status was independent of stomatal activity. Quercus frainetto was the least drought-resistant of the four species. During drought it developed very low water potentials despite markedly reduced stomatal aperture.","Natl Agr Res Fdn, Forest Res Inst, Salonika 57006, Greece; Aristotelian Univ Salonika, Dept Agr, Salonika, Greece","Radoglou, KM (reprint author), Natl Agr Res Fdn, Forest Res Inst, Salonika 57006, Greece.",,,"Fotelli, Mariangela/0000-0002-9310-5017",,,,40,81,84,1,37,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,OCT,2000,20,16,,,,,1065,1075,,,,,11,Forestry,Forestry,358ZG,WOS:000089586600001,11269958,,,,10/31/19J,"Toffanin, A; Basaglia, M; Ciardi, C; Vian, P; Povolo, S; Casella, S",,,,"Toffanin, A; Basaglia, M; Ciardi, C; Vian, P; Povolo, S; Casella, S",,,"Energy content decrease and viable-not-culturable status induced by oxygen limitation coupled to the presence of nitrogen oxides in Rhizobium ""hedysari""",BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,,,English,Article,,,,,,"Rhizobium ""hedysari""; oxygen limitation; nitrite reductase; internal energy pool; sinorhizobium meliloti",NONCULTURABLE STATE; NITRITE REDUCTION; VIBRIO-VULNIFICUS; STRAIN HCNT-1; CELLS; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; SOIL,"Rhizobium ""hedysari"" HCNT1 and Sinorhizobium meliloti 41 were investigated and compared for their ability to shift from a typical aerobic, growth-supporting metabolism to O-2-limiting, low-energy-expending, basal activities.

Total biomass growth was greatest in Q. alba, and least in C. florida. Fungicide led to a significant increase in biomass growth in Q. alba, a significant decrease in growth in C. florida and no change in biomass growth of P. taeda. Overstory composition had no significant effect on either survival or growth of seedlings. In general, these results suggest that: (I) the composition of the soil fungal community can influence growth of understory seedlings in some tree species; and (2) planting can be used to establish advance regeneration of desirable species in upland forests of the southeastern USA.

If inhibition of spruce germination and seedling growth due to allelochemicals is generally accepted, in contrast there is a lack of knowledge about phenolic effects on mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, this work tested effects of a humic solution and its naturally occurring phenolics on the growth and respiration of two mycorrhizal fungi: Hymenoscyphus ericae (symbiont of Vaccinium myrtillus, the main allelochemical-producing plant) and Hebeloma crustuliniforme (symbiont of P. abies, the target plant). Growth and respiration of H. crustuliniforme were inhibited by growth medium with the original humic solution (-6% and -30%), respectively, whereas the same humic solution did not affect growth but decreased respiration of H. ericae (-55%). When naturally occurring phenolics (same chemicals and concentrations in the original humic solution) were added to the growth medium, growth of H. crustuliniforme was not affected, whereas that of H. ericae significantly increased (+10%). We conclude that H. ericae is better adapted to the allelopathic constraints of this forest soil than H. crustuliniforme and that the dominance of V myrtillus among understory species could be explained in this way.","Univ Savoie, LDEA, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; Univ Vigo, EUET Forestal, Pontevedra 36005, Spain","Pellissier, F (reprint author), Univ Savoie, LDEA, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France.",,"Souto, Xose/H-5888-2015","Souto, Xose/0000-0002-3344-5810",,,,29,44,55,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

This work evaluated relationships between phenolic compounds and soil microorganisms in humus collected in spruce forest during winter and summer seasons. After having identified and quantified different phenolics from humus samples, we incubated another set of humus samples with 10 times the concentration of naturally occurring phenolics, and effects on the density of microorganisms were compared to humus with no addition of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, in order to follow the degradation of phenolic compounds by microbes, the concentration of phenolics in the incubated humus samples was determined by HPLC after three and six days of incubation. The results indicate that humus microorganisms use phenolics as a carbon source, since almost all phenolic compounds had disappeared after six days of incubation. Addition of phenolic compounds to the humus samples also affected the soil microbial populations so that bacteria were inhibited in the humus collected both in the winter and in the summer. However, there were differences between the experiments. Fungi and cellulose hydrolyzers were stimulated in the winter humus experiment, while fungi were unaffected and cellulose hydrolyzers were inhibited in the summer experiment. The addition of phenolic compounds stimulated ammonifiers in the summer experiment. We anticipate that the role of soil microorganisms in the problem of natural regeneration failure is probably more important than previously thought.","Univ Savoie, LDEA, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France; Univ Vigo, EUET Forestal, Pontevedra 36005, Spain","Pellissier, F (reprint author), Univ Savoie, LDEA, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France.",,"Souto, Xose/H-5888-2015","Souto, Xose/0000-0002-3344-5810",,,,45,71,80,2,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0098-0331,1573-1561,,J CHEM ECOL,J.

Both mass and proportion of thin roots increased with elevation, and so did mycorrhizae infection. The aboveground and belowground turnover rates decreased with altitude, but rates were faster for aboveground tissues. We found different temporal patterns in productivity, senescence and disappearance among grassland sites despite similar total NPP. Water holding capacity of soils and temperature were important factors related to several of the observed trends in structure and function.

Water use was evaluated relative to the maximum transpiration rate (E-crit) allowed by the soil-leaf continuum. We expected that trees on both soils would approach E-crit during drought. Trees in sand, however, should face greater drought limitation because of steeply declining hydraulic conductivity in sand at high soil water potential (Psi(S)). Transport considerations suggest that trees in sand should have higher root to leaf area ratios (A(R):A(L)): less negative leaf xylem pressure (Psi(L)), and be more vulnerable to xylem cavitation than trees in loam. The A(R):A(L) was greater in sand versus loam (9.8 vs 1.7, respectively). This adjustment maintained about 86% of the water extraction potential for both soils. Trees in sand were more deeply rooted (>1.9 m) than in loam (95% of roots <0.2 m), allowing them to shift water uptake to deeper layers during drought and avoid hydraulic failure. Midday Psi(L) was constant for days of high evaporative demand, but was less negative in sand (-1.6 MPa) versus loam (-2.1 MPa). Xylem was more vulnerable to cavitation in sand versus loam trees. Roots in both soils were more vulnerable than stems, and experienced the greatest predicted loss of conductivity during drought. Trees on both soils approached E-crit during drought, but at much higher Psi(S) in sand (<-0.4 MPa) than in loam (<-1.0 MPa). Results suggest considerable phenotypic plasticity in water use traits for P. taeda which are adaptive to differences in soil porosity.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Brookhaven Natl Lab, Div Environm Biol, Upton, NY 11973 USA","Hacke, UG (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Ewers, Brent E/A-9696-2008; Hacke, Uwe/M-7719-2015; Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Hacke, Uwe/0000-0001-5983-3582; Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Ellsworth, David/0000-0002-9699-2272; Ewers, Brent/0000-0001-6647-7475",,,,41,228,237,0,67,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2000,124,4,,,,,495,505,,10.1007/PL00008875,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,357PH,WOS:000089509700004,28308388,,,,10/31/19J,"Stenlid, J",,,,"Stenlid, J",,,Variation with and without sex in mycorrhizal fungi,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOMATIC INCOMPATIBILITY; DIVERSITY; VARIABILITY; ECOLOGY,,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Stenlid, J (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, Box 7026, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,"Stenlid, Jan/K-5909-2019","Stenlid, Jan/0000-0002-5344-2094",,,,21,3,3,0,2,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2000,90,3,,,,,609,611,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900319.x,,,3,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,363HQ,WOS:000089830000019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Paschke, MW; DeLeo, C; Redente, EF",,,,"Paschke, MW; DeLeo, C; Redente, EF",,,"Revegetation of roadcut slopes in Mesa Verde National Park, USA",RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mancos shale; Menefee shale; mulch; organic fertilizer; polymer; seeding; transplants,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; POLYACRYLAMIDE; SUCCESSION; NITROGEN; SALTS; SITE,"The geology of Mesa Verde National Park (MVNP) poses unique problems to road construction and maintenance. Major geologic formations of the Park consist of an overlying resistant sandstone cap underlain by highly erodable shales. Once this sandstone cap is removed, the shales are easily eroded away, creating the notable mesas of the region. In many places, road construction has removed the sandstone layer and vegetation resulting in unaesthetic barren slopes that require continual maintenance and have proven difficult to revegetate. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of several cultural techniques combined with seeding and transplanting indigenous plants for revegetation of these roadcut slopes. Techniques evaluated were fertilization, mulching, soil pitting, and polyacrylamide amendments. Replicated test plots were established at three roadcut sites in MVNP to evaluate these techniques by measuring percent plant cover by species over a 4-year period. A combination of seeding grasses and transplanting forbs and shrubs appeared to be the optimal way to maintain species diversity and structure on the roadcuts while accomplishing the goal of revegetating these difficult sites. The perennial forb Aster glaucodes and the shrub Artemisia ludoviciana showed high survival when transplanted in the experimental roadcut sites. These species, as well as the perennial grass Pascopyrum smithii, also established well from seed. The addition of an organic fertilizer, in combination with mulch, proved to be the most effective method of improving vegetation cover for these and other transplanted species.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Paschke, MW (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,"Paschke, Mark/E-3799-2013","Paschke, Mark/0000-0002-6345-5905",,,,28,28,30,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

However, recent choice experiments suggest that Collembola preferentially feed on nonmycorrhizal fungi in the rhizosphere. If these preferences also occur in field soils, then Collembola might indirectly benefit plants through an enhancement of mycorrhizal functioning and indirect multitrophic links to foliar-feeding insect herbivores.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Gange, A (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,36,129,141,2,60,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

In order to identify the morphophysiological variables that can be used in nursery for selection purpose, a study on growth, drymatter production, and rate of photosynthesis was undertaken with seedlings of four tree species, viz, Acacia nilotica, Albizzia lebbeck, Dalbergia sissoo and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The species varied significantly in growth, drymatter production and photosynthetic rate in nursery. E. camaldulensis was the fastest in growth and A. nilotica had maximum number of leaves. Total drymatter production was maximum in D. sissoo followed by A. lebbeck. The rate of photosynthesis was maximum in D. sissoo followed by A. nilotica and lowest in A. lebbeck. Among the various seedling attributes, height, number of leaves per plant, rootweight and photosynthetic rate exhibited significant correlations with seedling drymatter. Seedling diameter showed weak positive correlations with drymatter of both seedlings as well as two-year old field trees. However, number of leaves per plant, rootweight, shootweight and leafweight showed significant correlations with two-year field tree drymatter, the strongest correlation (r = 0.96, P = 0.001) was found between number of leaves per plant and field tree drymatter. Although plant height and leaf photosynthetic rate showed a positive correlation with two-year field growth, the relationship was statistically non-significant. The study reveals that maximum value for leaf number and dryweight of seedling components such as root, shoot and leaf can be used as criteria for selecting nursery stocks for field planting in semiarid conditions.","Tata Energy Res Inst, New Delhi 110003, India","Rawat, JS (reprint author), Tata Energy Res Inst, Habitat Pl, Lodhi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India.",,,,,,,26,7,11,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,,,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

Pisolithus tinctorius was the only significant producer of IAA in the absence of exogenous tryptophan. All the Paxillus involutus strains also synthesized both free and conjugated IAA but did that actively only from exogenous tryptophan. In vitro production of IAA did not correlate with root induction in vivo, but the rooting responses depended on the fungus strains and the Scots pine seed families and (or) genotypes within families. This indicates that in vitro IAA production capacity cannot be the only criterion when selecting ectomycorrhizal fungi for rooting in vivo and that specific genotype-genotype interactions play a key role in root initiation.","Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, Punkaharju Res Stn, FIN-58450 Punkaharju, Finland; Fdn Forest Tree Breeding, FIN-12600 Layliainen, Finland; Univ Tromso, Dept Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; Univ Kuopio, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland","Niemi, K (reprint author), Univ Kuopio, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, POB 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",karoliina.niemi@uku.fi,,"Heinonen-Tanski, Helvi/0000-0001-9850-0721",,,,46,19,20,0,1,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Seedlings were harvested at 4, 8, and 12 wk after sowing in the greenhouse and at 5, 10, and 15 wk after sowing in the nursery. Ectomycorrhizae colonization, estimated as the total number ectomycorrhizal roots per seedling and averaging by gram root biomass, were not evident on any treatment at either 5 wk in the nursery or 4 wk in the greenhouse. However, by 8 wk after sowing, many treatments significantly (P < 0.0001) inhibited ectomycorrhizal root formation. Generally, increasing the rate of all bacteria applied in the greenhouse decreased ectomycorrhizal root formation. Conversely, strain LS212 at 10(11) cfu resulted in an increase in ectomycorrhizal roots in the nursery. Increases in seedling root growth were also dependent on bacterial strain and rate, whereas shoot biomass was not effected. Decreases in ectomycorrhizae colonization accounted for 61% of the variation in increases in root biomass, suggesting high metabolic costs of mycorrhizal maintenance in the presence of some rhizobacteria. However, differences in shoot height and survival after outplanting could not be attributed to the mycorrhizae colonization effect. These studies demonstrate that mycorrhizae may serve as a carbon sink early in seedling development and indicate a complex interaction between soil microflora and bacterium in nursery and greenhouse settings.","Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Vonderwell, JD (reprint author), USDA, Sugarcane Field Stn, HCR Box 8, Canal Point, FL USA.",,,,,,,21,10,14,0,2,SOC AMER FORESTERS,BETHESDA,"5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA",0015-749X,,,FOREST SCI,For.

In the first type of experiments, radioactively labeled hormonal substances were applied to the stumps of decapitated apple-seedlings and the occurrence of radioactivity in root exudates and their qualitative characterization were examined (direct influence). In another set of experiments, the effects of leaf-applied plant growth regulators on the amount and composition of the predominant organic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids/amides were studied. Cherry seedlings resistant to SARD and apple seedlings with dormant apical buds and, thus, not susceptible to infection were used for comparison. The results showed no differences in exudation of applied plant growth regulators between growing cherry and apple seedlings. Thus, a direct effect of plant hormones on the infection process is unlikely. However, leaf treatments with growth regulators, in particular with auxin-type compounds and abscisic arid, increased exudation of alditols. This may indicate that plant hormones are, to some degree, indirectly involved in the infection process.","Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Pflanzenernahrung & Bodenkunde, D-06108 Halle, Germany; Inst Pflanzenschutz Gartenbau, Biol Bundesanstalt Land & Forstwirtschaft Berlin, D-38104 Braunschweig, Germany","Wittenmayer, L (reprint author), Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Pflanzenernahrung & Bodenkunde, Adam Kuckhoff Str 17B, D-06108 Halle, Germany.",wittenmayer@landw.uni-halle.de,,,,,,34,12,17,0,24,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1436-8730,1522-2624,,J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC,J.

We grew Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) cuttings for 2 years under two levels of atmospheric CO2 (36.7 and 71.5 Pa) and at two levels of soil N (210 and 970 mu g N gl). Ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations were applied using open-top chambers, and soil N availability was manipulated by mixing soils differing in organic N content. From June to October of the second growing season, Lye measured midday rates of soil respiration. In August, we pulse-labeled plants with (CO2)-C-14 and measured soil (CO2)-C-14 respiration and the C-14 contents of plants, soils, and microorganisms after a 6-day chase period. In conjunction with the August radio-labeling and again in October, we used N-15 pool dilution techniques to measure in situ rates of gross N mineralization, N immobilization by microbes, and plant N uptake. At both levels of soil N availability, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant and root biomass, and marginally increased whole-plant N capital. Significant increases in soil respiration were closely linked to increases in root biomass under elevated CO2. CO2 enrichment had no significant effect on the allometric distribution of biomass or C-14 among plant components, total C-14 allocation belowground, or cumulative (6-day) (CO2)-C-14 soil respiration. Elevated CO2 significantly increased microbial C-14 contents, indicating greater availability of microbial substrates derived from roots. The near doubling of microbial C-14 contents at elevated CO2 was a relatively small quantitative change in the belowground C cycle of our experimental system, but represents an ecologically significant effect on the dynamics of microbial growth. Rates of plant N uptake during both 6-day periods in August and October were significantly greater at elevated CO2, and were closely related to fine-root biomass. Gross N mineralization was not affected by elevated CO2. Despite significantly greater rates of N immobilization under elevated CO2, standing pools of microbial N were not affected by elevated CO2, suggesting that N was cycling through microbes more rapidly. Our results contained elements of both positive and negative feedback hypotheses, and may be most relevant to young, aggrading ecosystems, where soil resources are not yet fully exploited by plant roots. If the turnover of microbial N increases, higher rates of N immobilization may not decrease N availability to plants under elevated CO2.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Mikan, CJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,88,71,81,3,48,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2000,124,3,,,,,432,445,,10.1007/PL00008869,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,350FP,WOS:000089090500016,28308783,,,,10/31/19J,"Pavlis, J; Jenik, J",,,,"Pavlis, J; Jenik, J",,,Roots of pioneer trees in the Amazonian rain forest,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,tree roots; tropical rain forest; Colombian Amazonia,COLOMBIAN AMAZONIA,"On low fluvial terraces of the Caqueta River, Araracuara region, Colombia, tree root systems were examined with regard to their structure, underground stratification and biomass distribution.

Roots of particular species varied in the external features of their periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. Coarse skeleton roots differed in the shape and position of the plagiotropic branches and positively geotropic taproots or sinkers. None of the observed species could be identified as a shallow-rooted tree, in spite of the general fine root concentration in the upper soil horizon. In the two seasons of study, the terminal roots displayed prevailingly secondary anatomical structure and did not maintain much primary anatomical tissue in their apices. Neither ectomycorrhizas nor endomycorrhizas were detected in the samples. In a set of regeneration stages the amount of tree roots linearly increased with the age of growth. However, fine roots below 2 mm in diameter shared 80-90% of all roots in the upper 20 cm layer of all sample plots. In an old-growth forest, the total tree root biomass amounted to 39 ton/ha, thus being comparable to the underground biomass observed in similar tropical forests.","Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; Charles Univ, Fac Sci, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic","Pavlis, J (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Fac Forestry & Wood Technol, Zemedelska 3, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",,"Pavlis, Jindrich/E-7895-2012",,,,,52,22,23,0,14,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

The fungicides were the two abundantly used sterol inhibitors, fenpropimorph and propiconazole, as well as a commercial mixture of them. Benomyl served as a positive control, as this fungicide is known for its deleterious effect on AM fungi. At harvest, roots and hyphae extracted from the soil were stained for ALP activity. Benomyl inhibited fungal ALP activity of both internal and external hyphae at the low application level (1 mu g g(-1) soil) corresponding to the recommended field dose. Fenpropimorph had an intermediate effect, inhibiting both internal and external hyphae but only at the high application level (125 mu g g(-1) soil). Propiconazole decreased the activity of the external hyphae at the low application level (0.21 mu g g(-1) soil) but did not affect the internal activity at any application level. The effect of Tilt Top was similar to that of fenpropimorph.

The experiments were performed by comparing plots that had received additions of nitrogen-enriched water (35 kg N ha(-1) annually since 1991) by means of sprinkling system with plots only receiving ambient (about 12 kg N ha(-1) per year) nitrogen deposition. The above-ground EM sporocarp production was recorded in 1992-1996; the number of mycorrhizas and their gross morphotype differentiation were registered in 1992-1995, and the mycobionts of randomly selected mycorrhizas were identified in detail by ITS-RFLP analyses in 1994. The addition of nitrogen did not affect the species richness or diversity of below-ground EM fungal species. In total, 50 RFLP-taxa were distinguished, of which 15 occurred in both treatments and 29 occurred only in single plots. However, the species richness and diversity of sporocarps of EM species were lower in the nitrogen-treated stand. Spatial distribution patterns of below-ground EM fungal taxa were assessed at various scales, from centimetres to tens of meters. Aggregations of mycorrhizal morphotypes were apparent on the centimetre scale, whereas no apparent spatial pattern could be discerned in the below-ground community on the meter scale. in accordance with the survey of below-ground taxa, the sporocarp analysis revealed that most species were rare, and only a few were widely distributed.

One soil was from a flooded field in Sierra de Huautla, the native habitat of this legume, while the other soil was from a well-drained field in Cuernavaca, where rhizobia were found to nodulate the introduced S. herbacea plants. Nodulation of the plants was completely eliminated by flooding in the Cuernavaca soil, whereas nodules were obtained in the same soil under nonflooded conditions. In contrast, nodules were formed in Huautla soil under both flooded and non-flooded conditions. Most isolates, except isolate HS2, from Huautla soil and water were identified as R. huautlense by colony morphology, growth rate, PCR-RFLP of 16S rRNA genes, MLEE, cellular plasmid contents, and RFLP of nifH and nodDAB genes. Isolate HS2 was identified as Mesorhizobium sp. Isolates from Cuernavaca soil were different from R. huautlense in many aspects and were classified into five rDNA types within the genera Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Sinorhizobium by PCR-RFLP of 16S rRNA genes. R. huautlense is a water Rhizobium species. Growth by denitrification under oxygen limitation or with ethanol was observed for R. huautlense bacteria but not for the isolates from Cuernavaca. In an interstrain nodulation competitive assay under both flooded and non-hooded conditions, R. huautlense strain SO2 completely inhibited the nodulation of Mesorhizobium sp. Sn2, an isolate from Cuernavaca. From these results, we conclude that R. huautlense has the unique ability to nodulate S. herbacea not only in flooded soils, but in nonflooded soils as well.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Fijac Nitrogeno, Cuernavaca 62191, Morelos, Mexico","Wang, ET (reprint author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Fijac Nitrogeno, Ap P 565-A, Cuernavaca 62191, Morelos, Mexico.",,,"martinez-romero, esperanza/0000-0002-2295-2606",,,,43,18,19,0,7,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROBIAL ECOL,Microb.

A previously described laboratory model system (Staley, T. E. and D. R. Morris. 1998. Soil Sci. 163: 230-240) using an acidic (pH, 4.62), fresh Ultisol showed the ability to discern enhancement of growth and nodulation of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) as early as 3 weeks after planting, even when limed to only py, 4.83. We now report on the reproducibility of soil chemical alterations and plant and nodule responses using the identical system with soil collected from the same field plot about 1 year later. The effects of low-level liming rates (pH, 4.54-4.94) and rhizobial (Rhizobium leguminosarum by. trifolii) inoculation levels (50-5000 CFU g(-1) dry soil), of both fresh and re-wet soil on earlier (2 weeks) and later (4 weeks) growth and nodulation of Huia white clover were determined. Plant parameters (shoot mass, shoot N uptake, and root mass) were generally unaffected by liming at any of the inoculation levels at Cut 1 (2 weeks) in both soils, whereas most of these parameters were positively affected by liming at all inoculation levels at Cut 2 (4 weeks), especially in the fresh soil. Positive lime rate effects on nodulation were found at both cuts in both soils, but almost exclusively at the highest inoculation level. Thus, the interactive effects of liming and rhizobial population on nodulation were demonstrated, at 2 weeks, before significant Nz;fixation. Growth rates of asymbiotically grown roots, determined by short-term (hours) assays in soil-over-agar, paralleled the root mass responses to liming in the soil model system. Rhizobial viability, assessed in soil solutions extracted from the limed soils, decreased from about 10(7) to 10(6) CFU mL(-1) in 21 h. These results suggest that although seedling root growth and likely rhizobial viability are compromised within hours after planting and inoculation by soil acidity-related chemical factors, maintenance of a threshold level of viable rhizobia can lead to improved nodulation of white clover even at very low soil pH values.","ARS, USDA, NAA, Appalachian Faming Syst Res Ctr, Beaver, WV 25813 USA","Staley, TE (reprint author), ARS, USDA, NAA, Appalachian Faming Syst Res Ctr, 1224 Airport Rd, Beaver, WV 25813 USA.",tstaley@afsrc.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,21,6,6,0,0,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0038-075X,,,SOIL SCI,Soil Sci.,JUL,2000,165,7,,,,,567,577,,10.1097/00010694-200007000-00005,,,11,Soil Science,Agriculture,341CZ,WOS:000088574600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Kennedy, TB; Merenlender, AM; Vinyard, GL",,,,"Kennedy, TB; Merenlender, AM; Vinyard, GL",,,A comparison of riparian condition and aquatic invertebrate community indices in central Nevada,WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST,,,English,Article,,,,,,Toiyabe; Great Basin; rangeland; aquatic invertebrates; biotic indicators; riparian condition; ecological status; diversity measures,DESERT STREAM; LAND-USE; MACROINVERTEBRATES; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; ORDINATION; STABILITY; CATCHMENT; ECOLOGY; DESIGN,"The importance of maintaining healthy riparian communities to sustain natural stream processes and function is well documented. Land management agencies in the West are currently developing methods to assess and monitor riparian community condition to adapt land use practices that would better protect rangeland ecosystems. To determine whether these methods also provide an indication of abiotic and biotic stream condition, we compared the classification system of riparian communities developed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to physical parameters of stream condition and to aquatic invertebrate community assemblages. Thirty-three sites in 19 different streams of the Toiyabe Range in central Nevada were measured for water quality substrate characteristics, and fish abundance and diversity, We sampled aquatic invertebrates and calculated community indices based on environmental tolerance levels. taxonomic diversity; and abundance of sensitive taxa. USFS personnel classified these sites by dominant riparian plant community type (meadow, willow, or aspen) and ecological status (low, moderate, or high) using plant abundance data, rooting depth, and soil infiltration to determine similarities to potential natural communities. Riparian condition indices as well as community diversity were significantly correlated to proportions of fine and small-diameter substrate in streambeds. Accumulation of silt was significantly related to plant community type, with meadow sites expressing highest proportions. Further examinations indicated that 2 of 6 invertebrate community indices were significantly related to ecological status, with highest diversity levels occurring mainly in willow- and aspen-dominated sites in moderate ecological condition. Nevertheless, we show that several other environmental variables, including substrate characteristics, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and species richness of fish communities, were more strongly and consistently related to invertebrate assemblage patterns. Our results demonstrate that information on aquatic invertebrates and stream condition could augment the existing riparian classification system and provide useful monitoring tools to more thoroughly examine ecosystem health in rangelands.","Univ Nevada, Biol Resources Res Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA; Stanford Univ, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kennedy, TB (reprint author), Sierra Nevada Aquat Res Lab, Star Route 1,Box 198, Mammoth Lakes, CA 93546 USA.",,,,,,,75,6,7,1,29,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,PROVO,"290 LIFE SCIENCE MUSEUM, PROVO, UT 84602 USA",1527-0904,1944-8341,,WEST N AM NATURALIST,West.

The decline of red spruce in the mountains of the northeastern United States is one well-known example. We evaluated the impact of spruce decline by considering its effect on the prevailing gap dynamics. We compared plant composition, height growth, and indices of resource availability in gaps to the forest as a whole in four old-growth stands. In our study, there were no appreciable compositional differences between gaps and the forest as a whole. However, the relative height growth rate of saplings and seedlings was greater in gaps and was significantly different in three of the four old-growth communities studied. There were also significant differences in the response of species to gaps; birches grew faster than balsam fr which grew faster than spruce. The initial stage of vegetation recovery in the spruce-fir forest was dominated by advance regeneration of balsam fir. Much of the recovery in the hardwood-conifer transition zone will depend on the response of spruce, and therefore the closure rate of gaps will be constrained by the slow growth of spruce advance regeneration. In both forest types, the shortage of mineral soil seedbed restricted birch establishment and limited its role in vegetation recovery. Throughout the subalpine community, a large fraction of the potential radiation reached the understory regardless of canopy status (means ranged from 19% to 32% of potential radiation). In fact, gaps received less light on average than random points in the understory. Judging from indices of fine root growth, belowground resources were enriched in gaps relative to the forest as a whole. The lack of quantitative light gaps and the higher fine-root density in gaps suggest that the observed response of the trees resulted from changes in belowground resources or qualitative changes in the light regime. The phenomenology of gap formation influenced the gap environment and consequently the course and rate of recovery. Many red spruce trees died standing. These standing dead trees continued to intercept an important fraction of available light, Damage to understory plants and disruption of the forest floor were minimal. These aspects of the gap regime favored recovery via upgrowth of advance regeneration rather than the establishment and growth of seedlings. General recommendations when evaluating other instances of decline include: (1) assess the impact of decline relative to the existing disturbance regime; (2) consider the influence of the phenomenology of decline on the recovery process; (3) recognize that vegetation recovery also depends on the inherent community organization of the affected forests.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Battles, JJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Battles, John/G-8233-2012","Battles, John/0000-0001-7124-7893",,,,75,47,48,0,33,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

When ergosterol, which is a component of fungal cell membranes, was measured in the mycorrhizal roots and soil at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after inoculation with the AM fungus, the content of ergosterol in the roots increased from 0.036 mu g per plant (at 20 days) to 1.85 mu g per plant (at 80 days). Ergosterol content in the soil also increased with time, but the ratio of external to internal mycelial biomass decreased from 24.7 at 40 days to 5.6 at 80 days after sowing. The average ergosterol concentration in the external mycelia of G. margarita was 0.63 mg g(-1). It was estimated that at 80 days after inoculation, the biomass of internal and external mycelia of the AM fungus accounted for approximately 16 and 92% of root biomass, respectively. For comparison, ergosterol content in the roots of K. striata growing in the field was also measured.

Different 'species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a 'Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant 'species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of 'hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful 'species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant 'prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful 'species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of 'rainy days' and 'warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the 'species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Kleidon, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Kleidon, Axel/O-7843-2014","Kleidon, Axel/0000-0002-3798-0730",,,,37,119,125,0,37,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

On the coastal sand-plain of Myrdalssandur no spores of AMF were found on barren sand, and very few were found in 1- and 5-year-old reclamation sites of Leymus arenarius (lymegrass). A significantly higher number of AMF spores and root colonization were found in a 10-year-old reclamation site and in a natural old dune system of L. arenarius. AMF spores showed seasonal variation with higher occurrence in the fall than in the spring. On the volcanic island Surtsey, no AMF spores or root colonization were found on L. arenarius in 6- and 10-year-old dunes. However, AMF spores and root colonization were found in the 22-year-old Leymus dune. On Surtsey, a colonization pattern was found where AMF non-dependent plants were the first colonizers followed by AMF facultative plants, then by AMF-dependent plants. Today AMF facultative plants have the highest number of species but AMF non-dependent plants have the largest population size. Three different AMF inocula were tested on L. arenarius; growth of seedlings was improved significantly by an indigenous AMF inoculum compared with commercial inocula. Inoculation of nursery grown seedlings of L. arenarius followed by transplantation into barren sand seeded with L. arenarius is recommended because this method will ensure establishment of the plant and enhance succession.","Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Biol, Beirut, Lebanon","Greipsson, S (reprint author), Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Biol, POB 11-236, Beirut, Lebanon.",,,,,,,34,31,34,1,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Oxalate and citrate are dominant organic acids in the root exudates of many plants. These acids, among other factors, strongly influence the adsorption behavior of HAS-Mt and HyA-Mt complexes. In this study, we investigated the adsorption phenomena of Cd on the HAS-Mt and HyA-Mt complexes as influenced by oxalate and citrate. Without addition of oxalate and citrate, the adsorption of Cd on Mt was easy. However, in the presence of oxalate and citrate, the adsorption was strongly inhibited. In contrast, the WAS-Mt and HyA-Mt: complexes in the absence of oxalate and citrate hardly adsorbed Cd. In the presence of oxalate, the HAS-Mt and BSA-Mt complexes were able to adsorb Cd. Thus, optimal concentration of oxalate for Cd adsorption on both complexes could be determined. Similarly, the HyA-Mt complex showed an optimal concentration of citrate for Cd adsorption. However, the HAS-Mt complex did not adsorb Cd in the presence of citrate. We concluded that the optimal concentrations of oxalate and citrate for Cd adsorption depended on the form of Cd ions and their proportion in the solution. Based on the amount of Cd adsorbed and the distribution of Cd species in the solution, the adsorption of Cd on the HAS-Mt and HyA-Mt complexes took place in various chemical forms.","Ehime Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908566, Japan; Kochi Univ, Fac Agr, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan","Taniguchi, S (reprint author), Kochi Univ, Fac Agr, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.",,,,,,,28,12,14,1,3,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

Estimating root system growth rates is complicated because missing, discontinuous, and false annual growth rings make root cross sections difficult to age. These irregularities can occur even in roots of dominant conifers with rare or absent stem growth ring abnormalities. Incomplete rings were noted in the root growth rings of nine co-dominant interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) France) trees. Coarse root (> 1.0-cm diameter) elongation rates were estimated by fitting a geometric mean regression line to ring count and lateral distance data. In all nine roots examined, the geometric mean regression slope was well within the range of the 95% confidence interval for the ordinary least squares regression of lateral distance versus age, suggesting that measurement error may have been negligible. Coarse root elongation rates (which ranged from 2.8 to 15.3 cm year(-1) and averaged 7.4 cm year(-1)) in the interior Douglas-fir trees studied were much lower than those reported by others. This discrepancy may be a result of limited soil water availability, soil heterogeneity (both soil water content and soil texture were highly variable across short distances) and fragmentation of belowground growing space.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Richardson, A (reprint author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,"Richardson, Andrew D./F-5691-2011","Richardson, Andrew D./0000-0002-0148-6714",,,,19,9,10,0,5,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,2000,20,12,,,,,825,829,,,,,5,Forestry,Forestry,334RY,WOS:000088200500006,12651503,,,,10/31/19J,"Rood, SB; Zanewich, K; Stefura, C; Mahoney, JM",,,,"Rood, SB; Zanewich, K; Stefura, C; Mahoney, JM",,,Influence of water table decline on growth allocation and endogenous gibberellins in black cottonwood,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Populus trichocarpa; riparian zone; roots; water stress,RIPARIAN COTTONWOODS; SOUTHERN ALBERTA; POPLAR; RESPONSES; BRASSICA; SHOOT,"Cottonwoods occur in riparian areas where water table depth generally varies with the elevation of the adjacent river. Plant adaptation to the riparian zone requires the coordination of root elongation to maintain contact with the water table during the summer decline. We investigated the effects of rate of water decline on growth allocation and concentrations of endogenous gibberellins (GAs) in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. gr A. Gray ex Hook.) saplings. Rhizopods were used to achieve water decline rates of 0, 2 and 4 cm day(-1). Root elongation approximately doubled in response to the 2 cm day(-1) treatment, whereas leaf area was reduced. A water decline rate of 4 cm day(-1) led to water stress, as evidenced by reduced growth, increased leaf diffusive resistance, decreased water potential, and leaf senescence and abscission. Endogenous GAs were extracted, purified and analyzed by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring with internal [H-2(2)]GA standards. Across the sampled plant organs, GAs were generally highest in shoot tips and sequentially lower in basal stems, root tips, leaves and upper roots; GAs were thus abundant in rapidly growing tissues. Of the GAs measured, GA(1) tended to predominate, followed sequentially by GA(3), GA(8), GA(19), GA(20), GA(29) and GA(4). There was little relationship between GA concentration and growth allocation across the water table decline treatments, although GA(8) was consistently reduced in plants experiencing water table decline. Because GA(8) is the final gibberellin in the metabolic sequence, it might be useful for assessing historic patterns of GAs and growth rate. This study demonstrated changes in growth allocation in response to water table decline, but provided little evidence that endogenous GAs play a primary role in the regulation of root elongation in response to water table decline.","Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; Alberta Environm Protect, Lethbridge, AB T1J 4L1, Canada","Rood, SB (reprint author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",,"Rood, Stewart/H-7634-2019","Rood, Stewart/0000-0003-1340-1172",,,,25,24,28,0,8,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUN,2000,20,12,,,,,831,836,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,334RY,WOS:000088200500007,12651504,,,,10/31/19J,"Thomas, FM; Gausling, T",,,,"Thomas, FM; Gausling, T",,,Morphological and physiological responses of oak seedlings (Quercus petraea and Q-robur) to moderate drought,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Quercus; drought; leaf-root biomass ratio; osmotic adjustment; pressure-volume analysis,WATER RELATIONS; OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT; GROWTH; STRESS; EXCHANGE; LEAVES; LIEBL; WILLD,"To study their responses to a moderate drought, seedlings of sessile (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.) and pedunculate oak (Q. robur L.) were grown in outdoor lysimeters that allowed unrestricted root growth.

The decrease in osmotic pressures at maximum turgor and at the point of turgor loss in the drought-stressed plants indicated osmotic adjustment. The ratio of leaf to fine-root biomass was significantly diminished in the drought-stressed seedlings.

After extensive root colonization by the fungi, the other half of the divided root system was inoculated with G. mosseae. Prior colonization of one half of the split root system with any of the three fungi resulted in a clear suppression of colonization by G. mosseae in the other half of the root system. As carbohydrates are one of the principal elements of plant growth, AM colonization, which is supposed to present a carbon sink, on one half of the split root system, could affect root growth and thus root fresh weight, on the non-mycorrhizal half of the root system. Besides, the improved P-status of mycorrhizal plants has been suggested to affect further AM root colonization. Our experiment showed that neither the root fresh weight, nor the P-concentration differed significantly in split root systems of non-mycorrhizal control plants and in split root systems of half mycorrhizal plants. Thus the suppressional effect in prior AM colonized plants on subsequent AM root colonization seemed not to be linked to a competition of the AM fungi for carbohydrates or an altered P-status. A systemic suppression of further mycorrhization in mycorrhizal roots, which is not AM fungal species or genera specific is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

General properties of the dynamic system are utilised to interpret relatively simple measurements of standing biomass, necromass, and decomposition, in order to derive estimates of the process rates. The method is based on the finding that the ratio of fine root necromass to biomass is related to the specific rates of decomposition, mortality, and net growth. If the decomposition rate is measured and the net growth trend is determined from live root measurements, mortality and gross growth can be estimated using these relationships, provided certain regularity requirements are met. These requirements are explicated, such that the estimates can be easily assessed for reliability. To illustrate the use of the method, it was applied to the estimation of specific mortality rates in seven Scots pine stands of different ages and site types. A reanalysis of a previous sequential coring study yielded consistent results. The advantage of this method is that, unlike the standard analysis of sequential cores, it accounts for the possibility of simultaneous growth, mortality and decomposition. It is therefore applicable to situations with no apparent fluctuations or trend in the biomass and necromass levels. No minimum sampling interval is required; hence the method also allows for more extensive or prolonged studies.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Makela, A (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, POB 24,Unioninkatu 40, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",annikki.makela@helsinki.fi,,,,,,26,11,15,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0931-1890,,,TREES-STRUCT FUNCT,Trees-Struct.

An important feature of this symbiosis is the supply of photoassimilates to the fungus. Hexoses, formed from sucrose in the common apoplast at the root/fungus interface, can be taken up by both plant and fungal monosaccharide transporters. Recently we characterised a monosaccharide transporter from the ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria. This transporter was up-regulated in mycorrhizas, thus increasing the hexose uptake capacity of the fungal partner in symbiosis. In order to characterise host (Picea abies) root monosaccharide transporters, degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed to match conserved regions from known plant hexose transporters, were used to isolate a cDNA fragment of a transporter by PCR. This fragment was used to identify a presumably full length clone (PaMST1) in a P. abies/A. muscaria mycorrhizal cDNA library. The entire cDNA code for an open reading frame of 513 amino acids, revealing best homology to H+/monosaccharide transporters from Arabidopsis, Saccharum and Ricinus. PaMST1 was highly expressed in the hypocotyl and in roots of P. abies seedlings, but not in needles. Mycorrhiza formation led to a slight reduction of PaMST1 expression.

We used free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology to expose three 30 m diameter plots of a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest to elevated CO2 at 200 mu L/L above ambient levels, while three control plots were outfitted with FACE apparatus but were fumigated with ambient air. We quantified litterfall mass and chemistry, fine root biomass increment and turnover, CO2 efflux from soils, delta(13)C in soil CO2 soil CO2, soil microbial biomass C and N, and potential net N mineralization. After two growing seasons, elevated CO2 caused significant increases in loblolly pine litterfall mass and fine root increment. Within the first year of FACE treatment, the concentration of CO2 in soil had increased, and soil surface CO2 efflux was generally higher at elevated CO2, but this difference was not statistically significant. Loblolly pine litter C:N ratio, fine root turnover, microbial biomass C and N, and potential net N mineralization were not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Our results suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 may accelerate inputs of organic matter to soil C pools in loblolly pine forests, but it may also accelerate losses of C from belowground by stimulating soil respiration.","Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Allen, AS (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"Finzi, Adrien/A-7017-2016","Finzi, Adrien/0000-0003-2220-4533",,,,75,107,118,2,64,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The primary pollutants were nitrogen oxides derived from vehicular emissions. Extractable soil N on the gradient ranged from 5 to 87 mu g/g during the summer months. For comparative purpose, we also assessed AM communities in nitrogen-fertilized (60 kg N.ha(-1). yr(-1)) and unfertilized plots. Nitrogen enrichment induced a shift in AM community composition. In particular, an increasing input of nitrogen was associated with the displacement of the larger-spored species of Scutellospora and Gigaspora (due to a failure to sporulate) with a concomitant proliferation of small-spored Glomus species (e.g., Glomus aggregatum, Glomus leptotichum). A subsequent reduction in species richness and diversity las measured by Shannon-Wiener index) accompanied eutrophication. Nitrogen enrichment also significantly reduced spore abundance, modified the timing of AM spore production in the most eutrophied site, and reduced hyphal and vesicular root infection. The fertilization experiment yielded similar patterns to those found along the gradient, and hence nitrogen input most likely explains the relationship between anthropogenic pollution and shifts in the AM communities. Such changes also indicated that AM species were sensitive indicators of nitrogen enrichment. The CSS is currently undergoing a conversion to Mediterranean annual grasslands, especially in the more urban polluted areas, and the shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal community may facilitate grass dominance in this system.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Egerton-Warburton, LM (reprint author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,56,244,268,5,130,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Our approach relies on curve-fitting to relate empirical measures of resource acquisition with various aspects of plant size and form. These relationships are referred to as size-uptake relationships (SURs). We demonstrate the use of this approach by characterizing the size dependence of light and nitrogen acquisition within developing stands of birch seedlings. Results of a number of phenomenological studies have predicted that competition for light is expected to be size asymmetric and that competition for belowground resources is expected to be size symmetric. Our study provides the first direct empirical test far these hypotheses. Application of the SUR approach largely confirms predictions regarding the size-dependent nature of light and belowground resource (nitrogen) acquisition. The uptake of nitrogen by birch seedlings was size symmetric, regardless of which aspect of size we considered (i.e., root mass, root length, root surface area, number of root tips, number of mycorrhizal root tips). In contrast, light interception was size asymmetric in relation to height and leaf area, but size symmetric in relation to total plant biomass. Differences in the degree of size-asymmetry of Light acquisition between different measures of size were driven by the nature of the allometric relationships between plant height, biomass, and leaf area. SURs offer a tool for exploring some of the mechanistic processes related to resource-based interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to characterize simultaneously the size-dependent patterns of multiple resources within competing plant populations. We suggest that this approach may prove valuable for identifying how size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition vary through ontogeny. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a more mechanistic understanding of plant-plant interactions and the role that the SUR approach can play towards this goal.","Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Biol Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Berntson, GM (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Morse Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",,,,,,,98,81,95,0,58,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,1072,1085,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1072:CTSDOR]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Thomas, SM; Cook, FJ; Whitehead, D; Adams, JA",,,,"Thomas, SM; Cook, FJ; Whitehead, D; Adams, JA",,,Seasonal soil-surface carbon fluxes from the root systems of young Pinus radiata trees growing at ambient and elevated CO2 concentration,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated CO2 concentration; fine roots; Pinus radiata; soil CO2 flux,ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FINE-ROOT; DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION; N FERTILIZATION; PONDEROSA PINE; DOUGLAS-FIR; RESPIRATION; NITROGEN; TEMPERATURE; FORESTS,"Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration may result in increased below-ground carbon allocation by trees, thereby altering soil carbon cycling. Seasonal estimates of soil surface carbon flux were made to determine whether carbon losses from Pinus radiata trees growing at elevated CO2 concentration were higher than those at ambient CO2 concentration, and whether this was related to increased fine root growth. Monthly soil surface carbon flux density (f) measurements were made on plots with trees growing at ambient (350) and elevated (650 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration in large open-top chambers. Prior to planting the soil carbon concentration (0.1%) and f (0.28 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 15 degrees C) were low. A function describing the radial pattern of f with distance from tree stems was used to estimate the annual carbon flux from tree plots. Seasonal estimates of fine root production were made from minirhizotrons and the radial distribution of roots compared with radial measurements of f. A one-dimensional gas diffusion model was used to estimate f from soil CO2 concentrations at four depths. For the second year of growth, the annual carbon flux from the plots was 1671 g y(-1) and 1895 g y(-1) at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations, respectively, although this was not a significant difference. Higher f at elevated CO2 concentration was largely explained by increased fine root biomass. Fine root biomass and stem production were both positively related to f. Both root length density and f declined exponentially with distance from the stem, and had similar length scales. Diurnal changes in f were largely explained by changes in soil temperature at a depth of 0.05 m. Ignoring the change of f with increasing distance from tree stems when scaling to a unit ground area basis from measurements with individual trees could result in under- or overestimates of soil-surface carbon fluxes, especially in young stands when fine roots are unevenly distributed.","Lincoln Univ, Soil & Phys Sci Grp, Soil Plant & Ecol Sci Div, Canterbury, New Zealand; CSIRO Land & Water, CQDNR, Indooroopilly, Qld 4074, Australia; Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand; New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Christchurch, New Zealand","Thomas, SM (reprint author), New Zealand Inst Crop & Food Res Ltd, Private Bag 4704, Christchurch, New Zealand.",thomass@crop.cri.nz,"Thomas, Steve/F-2064-2013; Whitehead, David/AAB-1608-2019; Cook, Freeman/A-1238-2008","Thomas, Steve/0000-0002-9202-483X; Cook, Freeman/0000-0001-6044-2079",,,,44,11,17,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Ages assigned by eruption-wear criteria were not reliable for comparing physical measurements and population parameters by age among populations. Further, errors in ages assigned by eruption-wear in one age class were not equally balanced by offsetting errors in assigned ages among other age classes. This resulted in inaccurate estimates of population age structure when ages were assigned by eruption-wear criteria.

In a controlled environment, we tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship (trade-off) between RGR(max) and the capacity of these species to tolerate drought. We examined both physiological (gas exchange) and morphological (biomass allocation, leaf properties) determinants of growth for these eight species under three steady-state drought treatments (none=control, moderate, and severe). When well watered, the grasses exhibited a large interspecific variation in growth, which was reflected in order-of-magnitude biomass differences after 5 weeks. The species had similar gas-exchange characteristics, but differed in all the measured allocation and morphological characteristics, namely tiller mass and number, root:shoot ratio, dry-matter content, and specific leaf area (SLA). Drought affected tillering, morphology, and allocation, and reduced growth by 50 and 68% (moderate and severe drought, respectively) compared to the well-watered controls. With the exception of SLA, none of these variables showed a significant species-by-treatment interaction. We calculated three indices of drought tolerance, defined as the ratio in final biomass between all the possible ""dry""/""wet"" treatment pairs: severe/moderate, moderate/control. and severe/control. We found no significant correlation between these drought tolerance indices, on the one hand, and three indices of growth potential (greenhouse RGR(max), final biomass in the control treatment, and final:initial biomass ratio in controls), on the other. Based on these controlled-environment results, we hypothesize that the commonly reported correlation between plant growth potential and drought tolerance in the field may in some cases be explained by differential effects of plants on soil-water content rather than by differences in species responses to drought.","Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Fernandez, RJ (reprint author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, IFEVA Ecol, Av San Martin 4453, RA-1417 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,"Reynolds, James/G-6364-2010","Fernandez, Roberto/0000-0003-3094-569X",,,,48,105,123,0,65,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2000,123,1,,,,,90,98,,10.1007/s004420050993,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,311KW,WOS:000086884300011,28308749,,,,10/31/19J,"Hagvar, S; Edsberg, E",,,,"Hagvar, S; Edsberg, E",,,Vertical transport of decomposing spruce needles during nine years in a raw humus soil profile in southern Norway,PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,decomposition; needle litter; podsol profile; vertical transport,FORESTS,"In a podsol profile, the amount of time passed after spruce (Picea abies) needles fall from the trees is correlated with their depth position in the organic soil layer.

Investigations were also conducted to evaluate the effect of rhizobial inoculation on growth and N fixation of the valuable timber species, P. mooniana, during its early stages of growth. All the hosts revealed in situ nodulation, except A. bicolor which had nodule-like swellings on its roots. While four rhizobial isolates were obtained from A. bigemina, four from H. laurifolia and 18 from P. mooniana, no authentic rhizobia were isolated from A. bicolor. The nodule-like structures did not show acetylene reduction activity, and the plants failed to nodulate upon inoculation with rhizosphere soil. A. bicolor was therefore tentatively assigned as a non-nodulating species. This report includes the first description of root nodules in the endemic species A. bigemina and the indigenous species H. laurifolia and the isolation and characterization of rhizobia from them. Significant differences were observed among the isolates with regard to their infectivity and effectivity. One isolate from P. mooniana was outstanding in its infectivity and effectivity on the original host, as well as on siratro. Inoculation of P. mooniana with this isolate together with a reference strain significantly improved nodulation and N fixation and gave a 50% increase in plant dry matter under a low level of N fertilizer, during a 12-month growth period. It is suggested that the nursery culture of P. mooniana could be improved by inoculation under low N-input conditions. The ability of these rhizobia to persist in the soil for a 12-month period was observed by the use of strains marked with antibiotics.","Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; Inst Fundamental Studies, Sri Lanka Belgium Project Biol Nitrogen Fixat, Kandy, Sri Lanka","Kulasooriya, SA (reprint author), Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.",,,,,,,13,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

In order to assess this potential for a tropical forest community in Panama, we conducted three reciprocal inoculation experiments using seedlings from six native tree species. Seeds were germinated in sterile soil and then exposed to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in current association with naturally infected roots from adults of either the same or different species growing in intact forest. The tree species represent a range of life histories, including early successional pioneers, a persistent understory species, and emergent species, typical of mature forest. Collectively, these experiments show: (i) the seedlings of small-seeded pioneer species were more dependent on mycorrhizal inocula for initial survival and growth; (ii) although mycorrhizal fungi from all inocula were able to colonize the roots of all host species, the inoculum potential (the infectivity of an inoculum of a given concentration) and root colonization varied depending on the identity of the host seedling and the source of the inoculum; and (iii) different mycorrhizal fungal inocula also produced differences in growth depending on the host species. These differences indicate that host-mycorrhizal fungal interactions in tropical forests are characterized by greater complexity than has previously been demonstrated, and suggest that tropical mycorrhizal fungal communities have the potential to differentially influence seedling recruitment among host species and thereby affect community composition.","Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama","Herre, EA (reprint author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 2072, Balboa, Panama.",,"Lovelock, Catherine/G-7370-2012; Toby, Kiers/H-4819-2017","Lovelock, Catherine/0000-0002-2219-6855; Toby, Kiers/0000-0002-0597-1653",,,,39,99,108,2,68,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Needle primordium initiation continued until later and cold hardiness developed more slowly in the mild lifting season of 1994/95. The seasonal decline in shoot mitotic activity was generally similar each year, with apices becoming inactive in December. Cell divisions in roots ceased in November or December. Shoots began to deharden in early February each year, but the rates of dehardening were slow until March. Cell divisions in root apices resumed in February each year, compared with March for shoot apices. The vitality of the seedlings following cold storage was high for most lift dates except the October and April dates. The period of highest stress resistance (as indicated by cold hardiness levels) for lifting for immediate planting was from about late November/early December to early March; shoots were cold hardy to about -20 degrees C (LT50) at this time.

Root systems were pruned by leaving c. 19, 13 or 7 cm root from the root collar. Alternatively, coarse roots (>2 mm in diameter) were removed, leaving only the taproot and the fine roots (<2 mm) attached, or fine roots were removed from coarse roots and taproot. Growth of shoots and roots after one growing season was compared to an unpruned control under standard nursery conditions. Seedlings root pruned to 19, 13 or 7 cm were further tested under competition achieved by transplanting into a mixture of clover and grass. Pruning of the root system significantly reduced regrowth in terms of total plant DW in accordance with the severity of pruning, shoot DW being more affected than root DW. Removal of coarse roots depressed final root DW whereas removal of fine roots reduced shoot DW and hence root:shoot ratio increased. The study suggests that fine and coarse roots have different roles in root:shoot allocation. The competition test increased root:shoot ratio indicating that competition induced seedlings to allocate more of their resources into growth of the root system.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Ornimentals, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark","Andersen, L (reprint author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Ornimentals, Kirstinebjergvej 10, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark.",,"Rasmussen, Hanne N/P-5485-2014","Rasmussen, Hanne N/0000-0002-0181-9304",,,,16,10,11,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,,,NEW FOREST,New For.,MAR,2000,19,2,,,,,205,213,,10.1023/A:1006610805249,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,307QY,WOS:000086665500006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sutherland, JM; Odee, DW; Muluvi, GM; McInroy, SG; Patel, A",,,,"Sutherland, JM; Odee, DW; Muluvi, GM; McInroy, SG; Patel, A",,,Single and multi-strain rhizobial inoculation of African acacias in nursery conditions,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,African Acacia species; multi-strain inoculation; tropical rhizobia; nitrogen fixation; natural abundance N-15; nursery conditions,NITROGEN-FIXATION; NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; NODULATION; N-15; LEGUMES; COMPETITION; ALBIDA; PLANTS; GROWTH; TREES,"Inoculation experiments were conducted in Kenya on seven African Acacia species/subspecies (Faidherbia albia, Acacia karroo, A. arenaria, A. nilotica ssp. kraussiana, A. tortilis ssp. spirocarpa, A. tortilis ssp. heteracantha, A. senegal) in sterilised and untreated soil. The untreated soil contained 10(3) rhizobia g(-1). In six of seven species in untreated soil the multi-strain inoculated plants contained significantly more total nitrogen than control plants. The exception was A. arenaria in which significant increase in total nitrogen was achieved only with the single strain inoculum in sterile soil. In A. tortilis ssp. spirocarpa the single strain was better than the multi-strain inoculum. Significant increases over controls in dry weight ranged from 19 to 75% and in total nitrogen from 11 to 89%, Nitrogen derived from fixation (Ndff) was determined for three species/subspecies using the natural abundance N-15 method. Values for fixation for the best treatments in these species were A. nilotica 53%, A. tortilis ssp. heteracantha 45% and A, tortilis ssp. spirocarpa 44%, These are conservative values because of the relatively small delta(15)N values (-2.85 parts per thousand for A. nilotica and -2.52 parts per thousand for both species of A. tortilis) determined as the 100% fixation values. We conclude that: inoculation can result in substantial gains in nitrogen fixation in African acacias; multi-strain inoculation is preferable to single strain inoculation in some circumstances; A. nilotica and A. tortilis have at least moderate nitrogen fixation potential and the wide genetic variation found suggests that substantial improvement may be obtained by selection for this character.

As the soil structure classes used are very similar to an international classification (FAO, 1990), the derived relationships (class pedotransfer functions) could be widely applicable. A total of 49 unique combinations of primary and secondary structures were identified but the relationship between these structures and Kfs was poor. However, this relationship became clearer when the structures were grouped according to both the ped size and ped orientation. It improved further with the removal of data from horizons with significant amounts of vertically orientated angular stones or very coarse roots. Soils with vertically orientated peds larger than 50 mm had a geometric mean conductivity of 0.33 cm day(-1) while those with fractures in both the horizontal and vertical planes had a geometric mean conductivity of 4.1 cm day(-1). Soils with peds between 20 and 50 mm had a geometric mean conductivity of 17.9 cm day(-1) and those with peds < 20 mm had a geometric mean conductivity of 53.0 cm day(-1).

However, it is possible that plants will respond to N limitation at elevated CO2 concentration by increasing the specific N uptake capacity of their roots. To explore this possibility, we examined the kinetics of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 uptake by excised roots of Populus tremuloides Michx. grown in ambient and twice-ambient CO2 concentrations, and in soils of low- and high-N availability. Elevated CO2 concentration had no effect on either NH4+ or NO3- uptake, whereas high-N availability decreased the capacity of roots to take up both NH4+ and NO3. The maximal rate of NH4+ uptake decreased from 12 to 8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), and K-m increased from 49 to 162 mu mol l(-1), from low to high soil N availability Because NO3- uptake exhibited mixed kinetics over the concentration range we used (10-500 mu mol l(-1)), it was not possible to calculate V-max and K-m. Instead, we used an uptake rate of 100 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) as our metric of NO3- uptake capacity, which averaged 0.45 and 0.23 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) at low- and high-N availability, respectively. The proximal mechanisms for decreased N uptake capacity at high-N availability appeared to be an increase in fine-root carbohydrate status and a decrease in fine-root N concentration. Both NH4+ and NO3 uptake were inversely related to fine-root N concentration, and positively related to fine-root total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration. We conclude that soil N availability, through its effects on fine-root N and carbohydrate status: has a much greater influence on the specific uptake capacity of P. tremuloides fine roots than elevated atmospheric CO2. In elevated atmospheric CO2, changes in N acquisition by P. tremuloides appeared to be driven by changes in root architecture and biomass, rather than by changes in the amount or activity of N-uptake enzymes.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Lake Super Ecosyst Res Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337; Rothstein, David E/0000-0002-8426-9933",,,,32,27,39,0,14,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,MAR,2000,20,4,,,,,265,270,,,,,6,Forestry,Forestry,334RX,WOS:000088200400006,12651463,,,,10/31/19J,"Taylor, JH; Peterson, CA",,,,"Taylor, JH; Peterson, CA",,,Morphometric analysis of Pinus banksiana Lamb. root anatomy during a 3-month field study,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,root anatomy; metacutization; plasmalemma; suberin; Pinus banksiana,EUCALYPTUS-PILULARIS SM; ABSORPTION-TRANSLOCATION; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; SURFACE TISSUES; FUNGAL SHEATH; PERMEABILITY; ECTOMYCORRHIZAE; MORPHOLOGY; TRANSPORT; EXODERMIS,"Tree roots are variable in their growth rates, alternating between periods of elongation and dormancy. This variability may have a strong influence on root anatomy. In the present study, field-grown Pinus banksiana Lamb. roots were divided into four distinct anatomical regions (i.e. white without mycorrhizae, white with mycorrhizae, condensed tannin, and cork). Changes in root growth, the proportions of the root system occupied by the various regions, and cortical plasmalemma surface area (CPSA) were determined for 6- to 9-month-old ectomycorrhizal P. banksiana seedlings during a 3-month period (August through October) in northern Ontario. The region in which the greatest change in length occurred was the condensed tannin zone, which was also the dominant contributor to root length (up to 74% of total). The roots of seedlings grown under artificial conditions had the same zones but in different proportions compared to roots in the field. A correlation was noted between increased root growth, low metacutization, and high soil water availability. The CPSA data were assumed to be a factor influencing ion uptake capacity in a positive manner. Interestingly, increases in CPSA were not directly correlated with changes in root length for field-grown seedlings. The primary contributor to CPSA in the field-grown roots was the ectomycorrhizal zone (approximately 80%).

They were cold stored for 0, 2 or 4 weeks in desiccating conditions (gunny bags, 1.4 degrees C, 87% RH). An additional treatment consisted in a cold storage for 4 weeks in sealed polythene bags. Root growth potential (RGP), fine root electrolyte leakage (REL) and seedling water status variables were measured. Simultaneously, seedlings were outplanted. The seedlings lifted in November exhibited lower survival and RGP (except in pine) than those lifted in January and March. Cold storage for four weeks in sealed polythene bags did alter water status variables in none of the species, but decreased pine survival. Storage in gunny bags led to a desiccation in all plant components but in pine buds. In pine, RGP and survival after outplanting decreased with desiccation duration. In oaks, and namely pedunculate oak, desiccation lowered RGP, survival and growth after outplanting. In oaks, poor field survival and shoot dieback were associated with low fine root water content measured at the time of planting, and with low RGP. No satisfactory predictor of field survival or growth was found in pine.","INRA, Ctr Nancy, Unite Ecophysiol Forestiere, Equipe Bioclimatol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France; Cemagref, Div Ressources Genet & Plants Forestiers, F-45290 Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; Univ Dijon, Inst Jules Guyot, F-21004 Dijon, France; Inst Dev Forestier, F-75007 Paris, France","Guehl, JM (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Nancy, Unite Ecophysiol Forestiere, Equipe Bioclimatol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",,,,,,,41,24,29,0,6,EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,PARIS CEDEX 15,"23 RUE LINOIS, 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE",1286-4560,,,ANN FOR SCI,Ann.

CO2 levels were ambient air (A), ambient air + 175 mu mol.mol(-1) (A + 175) and ambient air + 350 mu mol.mol(-1) (A + 350). N treatments were 0, 100, and 200 kg N.ha(-1) per year (N0, N100, and N200, respectively). Fine root survival was strongly influenced by season and seemed to be most strongly linked to soil temperature. Roots born in the fall and winter had longer median root life-span (MRLs) than those born during the spring and summer. Elevated CO2 increased root life-span, but N fertilization decreased it. Under A, MRL was 74 +/- 12 days (mean +/- SE) and was significantly different from the MRL for the A + 350 treatment (102 +/- 14 days). MRL under A + 175 averaged 92 +/- 10 days. MRL was 116 +/- 13 days for the N0 treatment and was significantly greater than MRL for the N100 (70 +/- 10 days) and N200 (62 +/- 14 days) treatments. Assuming that longer lived fine roots continue their resource acquisition functions, then elevated CO2 may have the effect of extending the resource acquisition period. In contrast, fine roots in N-rich environments have shorter life-spans than fine roots in N-poor environments.","US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Lab, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; Dynamac Inc, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Lab, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Johnson, MG (reprint author), US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Lab, Western Ecol Div, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",,"Phillips, Donald/D-5270-2011",,,,,31,45,58,3,11,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

To gain further insight into these dynamics, we grew six genotypes of Populus tremuloides Michx. that differ in autumnal senescence (early vs, late) under experimental atmospheric CO2 (35.7 and 70.7 Pa) and soil-N availability (low and high) treatments. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were manipulated with open-top chambers, and soil-N availability was modified in open-bottom root boxes by mixing different proportions of native A and C horizon soil. Net N mineralization rates averaged 61 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in low-N soil and 319 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in high-N soil. After 2.5 growing seasons, we harvested above- and belowground plant components in each chamber and determined total biomass, N concentration, N content, and the relative allocation of biomass and N to leaves, stems, and roots. Elevated CO2 increased total plant biomass 16% in low-N soil and 38% in high-N soil, indicating that the growth response of P. tremuloides to elevated CO2 was constrained by soil-N availability. Greater growth under elevated CO2 did not substantially alter the allocation of biomass to above- or belowground plant components. At both levels of soil-N availability, elevated CO2 decreased the N concentration of all plant tissues. Despite declines in tissue N concentration, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant N content in high-N soil (ambient = 137 g N/chamber; elevated = 155 g N/chamber), but it did not influence whole-plant N content in low-N soil (36 g N/chamber). Our results indicate that plants in high-N soil obtained greater amounts of soil N under elevated CO2 by producing a proportionately larger fine-root system that more thoroughly exploited the soil. The significant positive relationship between fine-root biomass and total-plant N content we observed in high-N soil further supports this contention. In low-N soil, elevated CO did not increase fine-root biomass or production, and plants under ambient and elevated CO2 obtained equivalent amounts of N from soil. In high-N soil, it appears that greater acquisition of soil N under elevated CO2 fed forward within the plant to increase rates of C acquisition, which further enhanced plant growth response to elevated CO2.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Michigan, Biol Stn, Ann Arbor, MI USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Biol, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,59,87,104,1,40,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Because microbial growth in soil is limited by substrate inputs from plant production, we reasoned that changes in the amount and chemistry of these organic substrates could affect the composition of soil microbial communities and the cycling of N in soil. We studied microbial community composition and soil-N transformations beneath Populus tremuloides Michx. growing under experimental atmospheric CO2 (35.7 and 70.7 Pa) and soil-N-availability (low N = 61 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) and high N = 319 ng N.g(-1).d(-1)) treatments. Atmospheric CO2 concentration was modified in large, open-top chambers, and we altered soil-N availability in open-bottom root boxes by mixing different proportions of A and C horizon material. We used phospholipid fatty-acid analysis to gain insight into microbial community composition and coupled this analysis to measurements of soil-N transformations using N-15-pool dilution techniques. The information presented here is part of an integrated experiment designed to elucidate the physiological mechanisms controlling the flow of C and N in the plant-soil system. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether changes in plant growth and tissue chemistry alter microbial community composition and soil-N cycling in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability and (2) to integrate the results of our experiment into a synthesis of elevated atmospheric CO2 and the cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems. After 2.5 growing seasons, microbial biomass, gross N mineralization, microbial immobilization, and nitrification (gross and net) were equivalent at ambient and elevated CO2, suggesting that increases in fine-root production and declines in fine-root N concentration were insufficient to alter the influence of native soil organic matter on microbial physiology; this was the case in both low- and high-N soil. Similarly, elevated CO2 did not alter the proportion of bacterial, actinomycetal, or fungal phospholipid fatty acids in low-N or high-N soil, indicating that changes in substrate input from greater plant growth under elevated CO2 did not alter microbial community composition. Our results differ from a substantial number of studies reporting increases and decreases in soil-N cycling under elevated CO2. From our analysis, it appears that soil-N cycling responds to elevated atmospheric CO2 in experimental situations where plant roots have fully colonized the soil and root-associated C inputs are sufficient to modify the influence of native soil organic matter on microbial physiology. In young developing ecosystems where plant roots have not fully exploited the soil, microbial metabolism appears to be regulated by relatively large pools of soil organic matter, rather than by the additional input of organic substrates under elevated CO2.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Zak, DR (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,41,133,148,1,57,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Tests of the effectiveness of rhizobia isolated from several common Acacia species showed significant variation among host populations in plant growth but no indication that plant performance depended on which Acacia species the rhizobial isolate was derived from. Variation in effectiveness was primarily between rhizobial isolates within a host species rather than across rhizobial isolates from different hosts. No interactions were found between host population, host origin of rhizobial strain and rhizobial isolate. 2. A study using a range of less common Acacia species showed significant variation in performance of several species (A. silvestris, A. nano-dealbata, A. trachyphloia, A. filicifolia, A. leucoclada) as a function of the inoculating rhizobial strain; two other species (A. cangaiensis, A. glaucocarpa) were marginally non-significant. For A. filicifolia and A. silvestris, growth was significantly better when plants were inoculated with their own isolates vs. those from other host species. 3. Comparisons of the performance of a third set of Acacia species found that several common species (A. melanoxylon, A. mearnsii, A. irrorata, A. binervata) varied little in their response to particular rhizobial isolates; for these species, most host-rhizobial combinations resulted in similar growth responses. Several less common species showed significant variation in performance across the rhizobial isolates tested. 4. Preliminary investigations of host specificity among legume genera showed significant variation with respect to host performance as a function of the rhizobial isolate with which plants were inoculated. Some species (e.g. A. mearnsii and Indigofera australis) were variable in their responses, while others (e.g. Hardenbergia violacea and A. melanoxylon) performed well with most isolates. 5. A comparison of the effectiveness of several Acacia-derived strains on their own hosts vs. their effectiveness on the other legume genera in the study showed that, in general, the Acacia strains performed well on other genera. However, on some host species (e.g. I. australis) the Acacia strains were less effective than the Indigofera strains, suggesting some host specificity. 6. While there was a general correlation at the among-species level in Acacia-rhizobia interactions (i.e. isolates that performed well on one host species often performed well on others), growth performance with any particular host-rhizobial combination was more difficult to predict than within-species comparisons. Our data also suggest that, at least for the genus Acacia, rare species are likely to exhibit a greater degree of host specificity than hosts that are widely distributed, and re-establishment may require special attention with respect to rhizobial strains that are used. 7. Overall, these results have clear implications for applied projects focused on the restoration of degraded habitats or abandoned farmland. Simply replanting native species into such areas may be unsuccessful unless appropriate rhizobial strains are also reintroduced. Our results suggest that when no strains for a particular host species are available, strains from its closest relative will have the highest probability of success.","CSIRO Plant Ind, Ctr Plant Biodivers Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Thrall, PH (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, Ctr Plant Biodivers Res, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Peter.Thrall@pi.csiro.au,"Burdon, Jeremy/B-9913-2009",,,,,27,61,63,3,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

(Scrophulariaceae) is a biennial rosette plant. The species is rare in Egypt and its distribution is restricted to the Sinai peninsula. The investigated population was located in Saint Catherine, Southern Sinai. To assess the reproductive ecology of the species the population dynamics, age-specific survival, resource allocation, energy content, and seed longevity of a natural population were studied. The germinable seed bank represents an average of 0.08% of the seeds in the seed rain. The plants are juvenile during 33% to 67% of their lives. Total seed rain output comes from four different cohorts of adult plants. Seeds produced during the summer constituted 83.5% of the;total seed rain. Adult plants 15-18 months in age attained a maximum rosette leafiness of 2.85 m(2)m(-2) and a maximum root crown diameter of 2.3 cm. Highly reproductive individuals allocated the least dry mass to their roots. The root/shoot ratio was 0.25. Caloric content reached up to 6.37 kcal g(-1) dry mass in roots of juvenile plants and 7.5 kcal g(-1) dry mass in the summer seeds. Seed viability was higher in seeds produced during summer and autumn (9 years) as compared to seeds produced during spring (6 years). Life span ranges between 1 and 2 years, which results in an intra-population variation of survival, resource allocation, energy content, and seed longevity and viability. These variations act as an evolutionary filter, an important asset to increase the genetic diversity and stability of populations In areas with low or periodical rainfall.

GSI has so far been found exclusively in bacteria, and GSII has been found predominantly in eukaryotes. To date, only a minority of bacteria, including rhizobia, have been shown to express both forms of GS. The sequences of equivalent internal fragments of the GSI and GSII genes for the type strains of 16 species of rhizobia have been determined and analyzed. The GSI and GSII data sets do not produce congruent phylogenies with either neighbor-joining or maximum-likelihood analyses. The GSI phylogeny is broadly congruent with the 16S rDNA phylogeny for the same bacteria; the GSII phylogeny is not. There are three striking rearrangements in the GSII phylograms, all of which might be explained by horizontal gene transfer to Bradyrhizobium (probably from Mesorhizobium), to Rhizobium galegae (from Rhizobium), and to Mesorhizobium huakuii (perhaps from Rhizobium). There is also evidence suggesting intrageneric DNA transfer within Mesorhizobium. Meta-analysis of both GS genes from the different genera of rhizobia and other reference organisms suggests that the divergence times of the different rhizobium genera predate the existence of legumes, their host plants.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Turner, SL (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Turner, Sarah/K-4683-2012; Young, Peter/C-1446-2012","Turner, Sarah/0000-0002-8937-6922; Young, Peter/0000-0001-5259-4830",,,,41,157,170,1,21,SOC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0737-4038,,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

These five fungi would have been missed by many previous ecological studies because their sequences are not well matched to available taxon-specific primers and they do not stain well with the standard reagents used for morphological analysis, Based upon spore morphology, these species are currently assigned to Glomus and Acaulospora, and two of the species are dimorphic, exhibiting spore stages of both genera. This suggests that dimorphic spores are the ancestral state for the order and that one or the other morphology was lost in various lineages. Our analyses also show that Geosiphon pyriforme, a symbiont with cyanobacteria, is not necessarily a sister group of the Glomales; instead, it may be derived from mycorrhizal ancestors.

One potential consequence of drought is a reduced water transport capability of the xylem. This is due to drought-induced cavitation. We used the centrifuge method to measure the vulnerability of root and stem xylem to cavitation in six native shrub species. The shrubs fall into three categories with regards to rooting depth, vegetative phenology and plant water status during drought. The ""summer green"" group (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex confertifolia) sustains summer drought with a relatively shallow root system (<2.5 m), but maintains leaf area. A ""drought deciduous"" group (Grayia spinosa, Tetradymia glabrata) has shallow roots but responds to drought by dropping leaves. A ""phreatophytic"" group (e.g. Chrysothamnus nauseosus) avoids low water potentials by developing a deep root system that gives them access to deeper soil moisture. We hypothesized that cavitation resistance across these groups was adjusted to the amount of drought stress a species experienced. Drought experience was quantified by measuring plant water potentials over two growing seasons. As expected, we found a significant relationship between the cavitation resistance of roots and stems of a species and the minimum seasonal water potential. Shallow rooted, drought deciduous species showed the lowest water potentials prior to leaf shedding and they had the most resistant xylem. The phreatophytic shrub Chrysothamnus nauseosus always maintained favourable water potentials and had the most susceptible xylem, and summer green species were intermediate. This correlation between cavitation resistance and water potential suggests that a safe xylem is associated with some ""cost"" for the plant. We could identify two costs or trade-offs. The first trade-off was between safety and transport efficiency as reflected by vessel diameter. In 5 out of 7 species, there was an intraspecific relationship between vessel diameter and cavitation resistance. Roots, having larger vessels than branches, were also more vulnerable to xylem dysfunction. There was also an interspecific correlation between vessel diameter and cavitation resistance, but only for combined root and stem data. A second trade-off was found between safety and construction cost. Resistant xylem was strongly correlated with high wood densities, suggesting that thicker cell walls and/or narrower conduits translate into lower air permeability. Air entry into the conduit is known to be the cause of cavitation.","[Hacke, Uwe G.; Sperry, John S.; Pittermann, Jarmila] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Hacke, UG (reprint author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",hacke@biology.utah.edu,"Hacke, Uwe/M-7719-2015","Hacke, Uwe/0000-0001-5983-3582",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [999-6138]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation,"Financial support was provided by NSF grant# 999-6138 to J.S.

The purpose of the work reported was to assess if capsules containing nonionic carbonaceous resins could be used to non-destructively sample and compare rhizosphere organic compounds associated with contrasting plant communities. Polyester capsules (Unibest, Inc., Bozeman, MT) containing non-ionic carbonaceous resins, Ambersorb 563 or XA`D-7 (Rohm and Haas, Inc.), were placed within the rhizosphere of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the native grass, Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), as well as a bare-soil control in both greenhouse and field studies. At the end a 14-day period, resins were removed and extracted with sequential elution by water, 50% methanol, and 100% methanol. The eluent fractions were then analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total hexose sugars as anthrone reactive carbon (ARC), and total phenols. Samples were then concentrated by rotary evaporating to dryness and analyzed on HPLC equipped with a C-18 column and tunable ultra-violet (UV) detector or a photodiode array (PDA) detector. Ambersorb 563 resin extracts from greenhouse and field trials consistently showed 2 times more soluble C and 3-7 times more total soluble sugars in the rhizosphere of knapweed compared to Idaho fescue during the 1996 and 1997 field seasons. This difference was not observed using the XAD-7 resins during the rather wet field season of 1998. In these studies fescue was found to release higher levels of sugars than knapweed, but not significantly different than control soils. Compounds sorbed to the resins from the knapweed rhizosphere were more effectively eluted by methanol than water and demonstrated both the presence of carbohydrate groups and UV absorption. The XAD-7 resins allow for sorption of phenolic compounds similar to that of Ambersorb 563, but allow for far greater desorption of these compounds. Non-ionic resins may provide an effective means of capturing rhizosphere organic compounds in situ, but the low concentrations of sorbed compounds may limit their utility.","Univ Montana, Sch Forestry, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Inst Basic Problems Biol, Pushchino 142292, Russia","DeLuca, TH (reprint author), Univ Montana, Sch Forestry, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"DeLuca, Thomas Henry/B-4547-2012","DeLuca, Thomas Henry/0000-0003-1561-9597; Yevdokimov, Ilya/0000-0001-8979-8343",,,,28,25,26,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",24-Oct,,,COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN,Commun.

Earlier studies had already explored the roles of seed rain and seed bank as regulators of community structure. In this study, newly germinated seeds of seven tree species were planted in crevices and on ledges of natural cliff faces and were censused regularly for three years. When harvested, seedling roots and shoots were measured and dry weights taken. The study was also repeated on artificial cliffs constructed of limestone blocks in order to observe rooting characteristics. On the natural cliffs, Thuja occidentalis generally survived better than Pinus strobus, Picea glauca, Larix laricina, Betula papyrifera and B. alleghaniensis. The latter two were not planted until the second year of the experiment and survived into their second year. These results were similar to those in the artificial cliff experiments. There were several root and shoot characteristics and biomass allocation patterns that were associated with Thuja. Seedlings were shorter and had extensive root systems, but their root:shoot ratios were 1:2. They were able to maximize the length of root systems, but minimized biomass allocation to the roots. Seedlings of Betula papyrifera, which are also present occasionally on cliff faces, were also short and with extensive root systems. These results suggest that seedling establishment is an important process determining community composition on cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment, but that the process is protracted over several years. seedlings of many species are able to survive for one year; following this, however, there is a gradual decline in survivorship.","Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Cliff Ecol Res Grp, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Booth, BD (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Crop Sci Div, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",bbooth@plant.uoguelph.ca,,,,,,25,5,5,0,0,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2000,7,3,,,,,336,344,,10.1080/11956860.2000.11682603,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,347CD,WOS:000088908900010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hendricks, JJ; Aber, JD; Nadelhoffer, KJ; Hallett, RD",,,,"Hendricks, JJ; Aber, JD; Nadelhoffer, KJ; Hallett, RD",,,Nitrogen controls on fine root substrate quality in temperate forest ecosystems,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,fine roots; substrate quality; nitrogen; carbon fractions; temperate forest ecosystems,DOUGLAS-FIR SEEDLINGS; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; BELOWGROUND CARBON ALLOCATION; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; ABIES-AMABILIS; LEAF STRUCTURE; NEW-ENGLAND; LIFE-SPAN; DYNAMICS; AVAILABILITY,"Nitrogen controls on fine root substrate quality (that is, nitrogen and carbon-fraction concentrations) were assessed using nitrogen availability,gradients in the Harvard Forest chronic nitrogen addition plots, University of Wisconsin Arboretum, Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin, and New England spruce-fir transect. The 27 study sites encompassed within these four areas collectively represented a wide range of nitrogen availability (both quantity and form), soil types, species composition, aboveground net primary production, and climatic regimes. Changes in fine root substrate quality among sites were most frequently and strongly correlated with nitrate availability. For the combined data set, fine root nitrogen concentration increased (adjusted R-2 = 0.46, P < 0.0001) with increasing site nitrate availability. Fine root ""extractive"" carbon-fraction concentrations decreased (adjusted R-2 = 0.32, P < 0.0002), ""acid-soluble"" compounds increased (adjusted R-2 = 0.35, P < 0.0001), and the ""acid-insoluble"" carbon fraction remained relatively high and stable (combined mean of 48.7 +/- 3.1% for all sites) with increasing nitrate avail-ability. Consequently, the ratio of acid-insoluble C-total N decreased (adjusted R-2 = 0.40, P < 0.0001) along gradients of increasing nitrate availability. The coefficients of determination for significant linear regressions between site nitrate availability and fine root nitrogen and carbon-fraction concentrations were generally higher for sites within each of the four study areas. Within individual study sites, tissue substrate quality varied between roots in different soil horizons and between roots of different size classes. However, the temporal variation of fine root substrate quality indices within specific horizons was relatively low. The results of this study indicate that fine root substrate quality increases with increasing nitrogen availability and thus supports the substrate quality component of a hypothesized conceptual model of nitrogen controls on fine root dynamics that maintains that fine root production, mortality, substrate quality, and decomposition increase with nitrogen availability in forest ecosystems in a manner that is analogous to foliage.","Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Hendricks, JJ (reprint author), State Univ W Georgia, Dept Biol, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA.",,,,,,,64,61,97,0,29,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JAN-FEB,2000,3,1,,,,,57,69,,10.1007/s100210000010,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287MH,WOS:000085509300010,,,,,10/31/19B,"Valencia-Quintana, R; Sanchez-Alarcon, J; Romano-Galicia, F; Zamora-Campos, E; Nava-Galicia, CI",,"Raynal, JA; Nuckols, JR; Reyes, R; Ward, M",,"Valencia-Quintana, R; Sanchez-Alarcon, J; Romano-Galicia, F; Zamora-Campos, E; Nava-Galicia, CI",,,Cytogenetic effects of the sediments from the Zahuapan River (A preliminary study),ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND HEALTH SCIENCES,,,English,Proceedings Paper,International Symposium on Environmental Engineering and Health Sciences: A Joint Effort for the XXIst Century,"OCT 26-30, 1998","CHOLULA, MEXICO","US DHHS, Agcy Tox Subst Dis Registry, NCI, Occupat Epidemiol Brach, NIEHS, Superfund Bas Res Program, Pan Amer Hlth Org, Univ Amer Puebla, World Meteorol Org",,,WATER,"The presence of xenobiotic compounds in the environment has become an important problem.

Biological test for toxicity and genotoxicity are indispensable for the evaluation of reactions of living organisms to the environmental pollution and to have an indication on potential synergistic effects from various pollutants. Higher plants are very suitable as test systems for monitoring the presence of mutagenic substances in the environment. Therefore, the genotoxicity of water and sediments from the Zahuapan River were evaluated using the Vicia faba root tips assay. Samples from the Zahuapan River were collected at 3 different locations viz. Panotla, Presa San Lucas and Xicotzinco.

Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into 'attribute groups' based on the possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat use. 2. Non-hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature- and field-derived information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life-history traits. Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level acting as a covariable. 3. Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, hydrocharids and lemnids). 4. Some parallels existed with established theory on terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes. 5. A principal components analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and Cb) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of trade-offs between resistance and resilience traits,'functional plasticity' in traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are discussed. 6. Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free-floating surface or free-floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining half of this variation. 7. Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade-off between resistance-type traits (related to stream Lining, flexibility and anchorage) in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free-floating growth forms) in spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in shallow fluctuating habitats.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Willby, NJ (reprint author), Univ Stirling, Dept Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",n.j.willby@stir.ac.uk,,"Willby, Nigel/0000-0002-1020-0933",,,,103,134,136,3,60,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Although only two genera have been identified in culture, the taxonomic diversity of ericoid symbionts is certainly wider. Genetic variation among 40 ericoid fungal isolates was investigated in this study. PCR amplification of the nuclear small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) and of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), followed by sequencing, led to the discovery of DNA insertions of various sizes in the SSU rDNA of most isolates. They reached sizes of almost 1,800 bp and occurred in up to live different insertion sites. Their positions and sizes were generally correlated with morphological and ITS-RFLP grouping of the isolates, although some insertions were found to be optional among isolates of the same species, and insertions were not always present in all SSU rDNA repeats within an isolate. Most insertions were identified as typical group I introns, possessing the conserved motifs characteristic of this group. However, other insertions lack these motifs and form a distinct group that includes other fungal ribosomal introns. Alignments with almost 70 additional sequences from fungal nuclear SSU rDNA introns indicate that introns inserted at the same site along the rDNA gene are generally homologous, but they also suggest the possibility of some horizontal transfers. Two of the ericoid fungal introns showed strong homology with a conserved motif found in endonuclease genes from nuclear rDNA introns.","CNR, Ctr Studio Micol Terreno, I-10125 Turin, Italy; Univ Turin, Dept Biol Vegetale, Turin, Italy; Ist Patol Gen Vet, Milan, Italy; Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Perotto, S (reprint author), CNR, Ctr Studio Micol Terreno, Vle Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",,"Bandi, Claudio/J-7835-2018; Young, Peter/C-1446-2012","Bandi, Claudio/0000-0002-0181-4618; Young, Peter/0000-0001-5259-4830; PEROTTO, Silvia/0000-0003-0121-1806",,,,60,45,50,0,7,SOC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EVOLUTION,LAWRENCE,"PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0737-4038,,,MOL BIOL EVOL,Mol.

Circular plots around beech trees were isolated from neighbouring tree roots by soil trenching. After removal of the litter layer, N-15-labelled litter was distributed on the soil. Samples [labelled litter, soil (0-15 cm depths], fine roots, mycorrhizal root tips, leaves) were collected during the subsequent vegetation periods and analysed for total N and N-15 concentration. Mass loss of the N-15-labelled litter was estimated using mass loss data from a litterbag experiment set up at the field site. An initial and rapid release of soluble N from the decomposing litter was balanced by the incorporation of exogenous N into the litter. Fungal N accounted fur approximately 35% of the N incorporation. Over 2 years, litter N was continuously released and rates of N and mass loss were equivalent, while litter N was preferentially lost during the 3rd year. Released N-15 accumulated essentially at the soil surface. N-15 from the decomposing litter was rapidly (i.e. in 6 months) detected in roots and beech leaves and its level increased regularly and linearly over the course of the labelling experiment. After 3 years, about 2% of the original litter N had accumulated in the trees. 15N budgets indicated that soluble N was the main source for soil microbial biomass. Nitrogen accumulated in storage compounds was the main source of leaf N, while soil organic N was the main source of mycorrhizal N. Use of N-15-labelled beech litter as decomposing substrate allowed assessment of the fate of litter N in the soil and tree N pools in a beech forest on different time scales.","INRA, Ctr Nancy Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France; CNRS, UPR 8481, CEFE, F-34033 Montpellier, France","Zeller, B (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Nancy Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",,,,,,,41,78,81,3,67,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,2000,123,4,,,,,550,559,,10.1007/PL00008860,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,333WT,WOS:000088154300014,28308764,,,,10/31/19B,"Salt, DE; Kato, N; Kramer, U; Smith, RD; Raskin, I",,"Terry, N; Banuelos, G",,"Salt, DE; Kato, N; Kramer, U; Smith, RD; Raskin, I",,,The role of root exudates in nickel hyperaccumulation and tolerance in accumulator and nonaccumulator species of Thlaspi,PHYTOREMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL AND WATER,,,English,Proceedings Paper,Symposium on Phytoremediation of Trace Elements in Contaminated Soil and Water at the 4th International Conference on the Biogeochemistry of Trace Elements,"JUN, 1997","UNIV CA BERKELEY, BERKELEY, CA",,UNIV CA BERKELEY,,OAT ROOTS; TRANSPORT; ZINC; PLANTS; PHYTOSIDEROPHORES; BRASSICACEAE; MECHANISMS; TONOPLAST; RELEASE; CADMIUM,,"No Arizona Univ, Dept Chem, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Salt, DE (reprint author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Chem, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",,"Salt, David/B-3864-2009; Kato, Naohiro/B-2353-2008; Kraemer, Ute/C-5025-2008","Kraemer, Ute/0000-0001-7870-4508",,,,26,57,67,0,5,LEWIS PUBLISHERS INC,BOCA RATON,"2000 CORPORATE BLVD NW, BOCA RATON, FL 33431 USA",,,1-56670-450-2,,,,2000,,,,,,,189,200,,,,,12,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences; Soil Science,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,BP09V,WOS:000084110400010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Samardakiewicz, S; Wozny, A",,,,"Samardakiewicz, S; Wozny, A",,,The distribution of lead in duckweed (Lemna minor L.) root tip,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,duckweed; Pb; transport; X-ray microanalysis,LOCALIZATION; TOXICITY; PLANTS; METAL,"While considerable information on lead distribution in the cells of terrestrial plants has been collected, little is known about lead localization in the cells of the aquatic plant.

After 6 and 12 h, the lead content of cell walls gradually increased. The changes of lead level between vacuoles and cell walls may result from redistribution of this metal from symplast to cell walls or it may reflect increased apoplastic transport. Lead was not found in the ground cytoplasm of any variants of the experiments. This fact and presence of lead in small vesicles suggests that endocytosis may play the role in lead uptake in Lemna.","Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Lab Gen Bot, PL-61713 Poznan, Poland","Samardakiewicz, S (reprint author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Lab Gen Bot, Aleja Niepodleglosci 14, PL-61713 Poznan, Poland.",,"Samardakiewicz, Slawomir/A-6741-2008","Samardakiewicz, Slawomir/0000-0003-4924-253X",,,,20,38,44,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,226,1,,,,,107,111,,10.1023/A:1026440730839,,,5,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,381XA,WOS:000165788300012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Dodd, JC; Boddington, CL; Rodriguez, A; Gonzalez-Chavez, C; Mansur, I",,,,"Dodd, JC; Boddington, CL; Rodriguez, A; Gonzalez-Chavez, C; Mansur, I",,,"Mycelium of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) from different genera: form, function and detection",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Workshop on Methods for Study of the Hyphae of AMH,"JUL 01-04, 1998","SWEDISH UNIV AGR, DEPT MICROBIOL, UPPSALA, SWEDEN","ICOM2, COST","SWEDISH UNIV AGR, DEPT MICROBIOL",arbuscular mycorrhizas; ecological function; isozymes; morphology; mycelium architecture; molecular probes,POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM L; ALLIUM-PORRUM L; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EXTERNAL HYPHAE; CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; COLONIZING ROOTS; CO2 ENRICHMENT,"It is often assumed that all species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have the same function because of the ubiquity of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the fact that all AMF occupy the same plant/soil niche.

We showed that G. rosea, when growing in axenic culture in the absence of the host, ceased growth within 8 days of germination and underwent a process of protoplasm retraction from hyphal tips, leading to the formation of empty mycelial segments. A process of resource reallocation was inferred in spores of G. rosea showing multiple germination.

The in vivo NMR method allows biological systems to be studied non-invasively and non-destructively. (3)1P NMR experiments provide information about cytoplasmic and vacuolar pH, based on the pH-dependent chemical shifts of the signals arising from the inorganic P (P-i) located in the two compartments. Similarly, the resonances arising from alpha, beta and gamma phosphates of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) and nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) supply knowledge about the metabolic activity and the energetic status of the tissue. In addition, the kinetic behaviour of P uptake and storage can be determined with this method. The (3)1P NMR spectra of excised AM fungi and mycorrhizal roots contained signals from polyphosphate (PolyP), which were absent in the spectra of nonmycorrhizal roots. This demonstrated that the P-i taken up by the fungus was transformed into PolyP with a short chain length.

The total annual symbiotic N-2 fixation was compared with other sources of N for plant growth of the total plant community (mineralisation and wet deposition). The contribution of symbiotically fixed N to total above-ground N yield of the swards decreased from at least 16% to 9% with increasing altitude where legumes were present. This decrease was due to a decrease in the yield proportion of legumes from 15% at 900 and 1380 m a.s.l. to 5% at 2100 and 2300 m a.s.l. (no legumes were found above 2750 m a.s.l.) and not to a decline in the activity of symbiotic N-2 fixation. With increasing altitude legumes are more patchily distributed. The high symbiotic N-2 fixation of individual plants up to their altitudinal limit is not primarily the result of low mineral N availability since an addition of NH4+ or NO3- fertiliser at 2300 m a.s.l. led either to no decrease or only to a minor decrease in symbiotic N-2 fixation. At 1380 m a.s.l., N mineralisation (13.45 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) appeared to be the main source of N for growth of the sward; N from symbiosis (at least 1.0 g to 2.6 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) and wet deposition (0.4 g to 0.6 g m(-2) yr(-)1) was not a significant N source for plant growth at this altitude. At 2100 m a.s.l., the combined amounts of N from symbiotic N-2 fixation (at least 0.1 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) and wet deposition (0.3 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) appeared to be similarly important for plant growth as soil N mineralisation (0.47 g N m(-2) yr(-1)). At high altitudes, wet N deposition and symbiotic N-2 fixation together represent a significant source of N for the grassland ecosystem while at low altitudes these N inputs appear to be much less important.","ETH Zurich, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Jacot, KA (reprint author), ETH Zurich, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Luscher, Andreas/E-2944-2018","Andreas, Luescher/0000-0001-8158-1721",,,,30,28,28,2,22,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,225,2-Jan,,,,,201,211,,10.1023/A:1026524212074,,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,381WZ,WOS:000165788200020,,,,,10/31/19J,"Stangoulis, JCR; Webb, MJ; Graham, RD",,,,"Stangoulis, JCR; Webb, MJ; Graham, RD",,,Boron efficiency in oilseed rape: II.

We analyzed 1000 surface soil samples taken from nine 50-m radius circular plots sampled in December of 1991 and May of 1992 on 'The Island', one of the few undisturbed areas of sagebrush-grass shrubland in Oregon. Spatial structure was interpreted from correlograms (Moran's I) and standardized semivariograms. The presence of juniper was associated with increased bare area and smaller, more widely spaced grass and sagebrush plants. Soil arthropod numbers and biomass in plots with juniper were only roughly one-fifth of those in sagebrush-grass plots in December. The dominant soil pattern in both sagebrush-grass and juniper-sagebrush-grass plots was regularly-distributed patches spanning a range of sizes and spacings. Plots with juniper had greater patchiness at shorter lags (<3 m), and patchiness was more developed for soil moisture, net nitrification, and net N mineralization, whereas sagebrush-grass plots had greater patchiness at longer lags (3 - 9 m) and patchiness was more developed for NO3-N, arthropod numbers and biomass. These differences in soil patterns with and without juniper indicate that juniper responds to, or causes, changes in the size of resource islands under sage and grass when it invades sage-grass communities.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Roberts, C (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",jonesj@geo.orst.edu,,,,,,55,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,223,2-Jan,,,,,47,61,,10.1023/A:1004745329332,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,351CF,WOS:000089137900005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Pan, B; Smith, DL",,,,"Pan, B; Smith, DL",,,"Genistein preincubation of Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells improves strain competitiveness under greenhouse, but not field conditions",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bradyrhizobium japonicum; genistein; soybean; strain competitiveness,GLYCINE-MAX; RHIZOBIUM-JAPONICUM; NODULE FORMATION; TEMPERATURE; NODULATION; SOYBEANS; ABILITY,"In the soybean-B. japonicum symbiosis, genistein has been identified as one of the major compounds in soybean seed and root exudates responsible for inducing expression of the B. japonicum nodYABC operon.

Two methods were applied to soil from a long-term field experiment with NaHCO3-extractable soil P levels of 24 and 50 mg kg(-1) in an experiment under controlled conditions: i) Measurement of plant growth and P uptake in the presence or absence of the fungicide benomyl and ii) measurement of hyphal P transport from a root-free compartment labelled with P-32. Benomyl successfully prevented mycorrhizal function. The absolute contribution of AMF to plant P uptake was of the same magnitude with or without P fertilisation at 27 days after sowing. Therefore, even though plants grown at the higher soil P level had greater P uptake, the relative contribution of AMF to P uptake was greater at the lower P level than at the higher P level (77 and 49% of total P uptake, respectively). The AMF in P-fertilized soil transported less P-32 from the root-free compartment to the plant after 23 days than the AMF in unfertilized soil, but this difference disappeared in plants harvested after 27 and 32 days. The production of hyphae was largely similar in both fertilization treatments, indicating that the capacity for P uptake and transport by hyphae of the two AMF communities was similar.","Riso Natl Lab, Plant Biol & Biogeochem Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; Agr Res Ctr Finland, Partala, Juva 51900, Finland","Thingstrup, I (reprint author), Riso Natl Lab, Plant Biol & Biogeochem Dept, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",,"Jakobsen, Iver/F-1116-2011; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535",,,,37,34,37,3,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,221,2,,,,,181,187,,10.1023/A:1004721626216,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,331WC,WOS:000088040800007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sanginga, N; Lyasse, O; Singh, BB",,,,"Sanginga, N; Lyasse, O; Singh, BB",,,Phosphorus use efficiency and nitrogen balance of cowpea breeding lines in a low P soil of the derived savanna zone in West Africa,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); N-2 fixation; N harvest index; P uptake; cowpea (Vigna unguiculata); P use efficiency,INFECTION; ROOTS,"Differences in growth, nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) root infection among recent cowpea breeding lines from IITA were examined at low and high P levels in pot (94 lines) and field experiments (43 lines) at Fashola in the derived savanna zone of Nigeria.

About 42% of the breeding lines (18 out of 43 lines tested) had the same grouping for the field and pot experiments. Eight cowpea lines (4 P-responders and 4 non-P-responders) were selected from the first experiment for subsequent studies on the effect of P supply (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg P ha(-1)) on P uptake, P use efficiency, dry matter production, N-fixation, AMF infection and N balance. Dry matter production, shoot/root ratio, total shoot N, and total N-fixed of the non-P-responder line, IT81D-715, were strongly related to P uptake efficiency. The P-responder IT81D-849 had a significant (95%) correlation between AMF and P-use efficiency. The cowpea lines fixed on average 22 kg N ha(-1), which was 70% of the plant total N. The N balance based on the difference between the amount of N-2 fixed and N exported through the harvest, ranged between -10.6 kg N ha(-1) and +7.7 kg N ha(-1). Based on its adaptability to grow in low P soils and overall positive N balance, the cowpea line IT81D-715 should be recommended for cultivation when P is the limiting factor.","Int Inst Trop Agr, Ibadan, Nigeria","Sanginga, N (reprint author), LW Lambourn & Co, Carolyn House,26 Dingwall Rd, Croydon CR9 3EE, England.",,,,,,,16,69,79,0,29,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,220,2-Jan,,,,,119,128,,10.1023/A:1004785720047,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,314RC,WOS:000087070300010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Howieson, JG; Nutt, B; Evans, P",,,,"Howieson, JG; Nutt, B; Evans, P",,,"Estimation of host-strain compatibility for symbiotic N-fixation between Rhizobium meliloti, several annual species of Medicago and Medicago sativa",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,lucerne; rhizobia; N-fixation; hybridisation; effectiveness; medic,ACID,"Standard methods for estimating host-strain compatibility for N-fixation in vitro proved inadequate for examination of the symbiosis between Rhizobium meliloti and Medicago sativa, M. littoralis, M. tornata as well as for hybrids between M. littoralis and M. truncatula. When screening procedures in soil free of background R. meliloti were adopted, nitrogen fixation appeared to be unrestricted by the screening environment. During the experiments it became clear that the single commercial inoculant strain available in Australia (CC169) was poorly effective at N-fixation with many of the lucerne and annual medic cultivars examined. Interspecific hybridisation between M. truncatula and M. littoralis also produced genotypes that were particularly difficult to satisfy in a symbiotic sense.

A gradient in forest floor thickness exists across these plantations; the forest floor is thickest in the west and it becomes progressively thinner toward the east. Decomposition of imported litter increased from west to east, suggesting that the variation in forest floor thickness is related to variation in the rate of decomposition. Decomposition rates were related to saprotroph abundance. Variation in forest floor N and phenolic concentrations, in overall mycorrhiza density and in the relative proportions of three common mycorrhiza morphotypes could not explain the variation in decomposition rate. The P concentrations and pH of the forest floor were significantly lower at Clear Creek and Moshannon, where decomposition rates were lowest, compared to Sproul and Tiadaghton, where decomposition rates were most rapid.

Root length and root-diameter distribution may be obtained in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by the shape of the curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0.5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs to be modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e.g., 24 h) is recommended for all stains, as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue is saturated. To enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Estuarine & Coastal Ecol, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands; Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Ornamentals, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark","Bouma, TJ (reprint author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Estuarine & Coastal Ecol, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands.",bouma@cemo.nioo.knaw.nl,"Bouma, Tjeerd/A-9841-2011",,,,,35,188,198,0,85,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,2000,218,2-Jan,,,,,185,196,,10.1023/A:1014905104017,,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,284AE,WOS:000085307600018,,,,,10/31/19J,"Jager-Zurn, I",,,,"Jager-Zurn, I",,,Developmental morphology of roots and root-borne shoots of Podostemum subulatum as compared with Zeylanidium olivaceum (Podostemaceae-Podostemoideae) Part VII of the series 'Morphology of Podostemaceae',PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Podostemum subulatum; Zeylanidium olivaceum; Podostemaceae; Podostemoideae; root; crustose root; root-borne shoot; modification of roots; root cap,TAXONOMY; INDIA,"The root structure of Podostemum subulatum is investigated and compared with that of Zeylanidium olivaceum.

Three populations of Pinus merkusii Jungh. et de Vriese, originating from northern and northeastern Thailand, were grown under controlled environment for 47 weeks to obtain parameter information, to evaluate the model performance and to investigate genotypic variation in various characteristics among the populations. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the model behaviour to varying parameter values and to calibrate the model for each population. With given sets of parameter values, the simulated biomass development fitted rather well the observed one during the experiment. The two most important parameters determining model performance were within-shoot shading and specific nitrogen uptake rate of fine roots. The fit of simulated versus measured fine roots had a major effect on acceptable model performance in Monte Carlo simulations. Significant variation in biomass growth, nitrogen use efficiency, height, stem diameter, total carbon concentrations of stem and fine roots, and total nitrogen concentrations of needles, transport roots and fine roots was found among the populations. The observed genotypic variation in seedling biomass and stem diameter was consistent with the geographical distribution of the populations while the variation in the rest of the measured characteristics was not. It seems that P. merkusii populations in Thailand are adapted to more site specific conditions rather than climatic conditions alone, and that the variation in biomass growth may result from variation in internal carbon and nitrogen dynamics among the populations.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Trop Silviculture Unit, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Koskela, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, Trop Silviculture Unit, POB 28, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",jarkko.koskela@helsinki.fi,,,,,,41,9,9,0,2,FINNISH SOC FOREST SCIENCE-NATURAL RESOURCES INST FINLAND,VANTAA,"PO BOX 18, FI-01301 VANTAA, FINLAND",0037-5330,2242-4075,,SILVA FENN,Silva.

As a first step, such features were studied on the basis of the estimated absorption activity of roots as reflected by sap flow measured at tree trunks or coarse roots close to trunk basis. Sap flow in roots responded immediately to an abrupt damage of the conducting system corresponding in extent to the importance of a particular part of the root system. It is possible to study the behaviour of coarse roots when measuring sap flow in trunks above them, if the corresponding conducting pathway is exactly determined or sufficiently wide; this is difficult if only a single root is treated. Experiments indicated that a compensation mechanism operates in trees, allowing for a temporary increase in the absorbtion of additional water (as reflected by sap flow) by using only one part of the root system in such cases where another part of the root system is damaged or looses its water source.","Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno, Czech Republic","Nadezhdina, N (reprint author), Mendel Univ Agr & Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol, Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Kulhavy, Jiri/Q-2775-2016; Nadezhdina, Nadezhda/E-6075-2014",,,,,29,3,3,0,0,EUROPEAN FOREST INSTITUTE,JOENSUU,"TORIKATU 34, FIN-80100 JOENSUU, FINLAND",1237-8801,,952-9844-76-X,EUR FOREST INST PROC,,,2000,,33,,,,,167,175,,,,,5,Forestry,Forestry,BU32W,WOS:000175704300017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lebel, T; Castellano, MA",,,,"Lebel, T; Castellano, MA",,,Australasian truffle-like fungi.

The early mycological history in Australia is linked to the first expeditions and collections of plant material by naturalists from 1790 to 1830. These collections were sent to, and described by, foreign mycologists such as the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, the Rev. C. Kalchbrenner and E. M. Fries. M. C. Cooke's (1892) Handbook of Australian Fungi was the first attempt at compiling an Australian mycoflora. D. McAlpine and L. Rodway were the first resident collectors to expand on the information collated by Cooke. Later, G. H. Cunningham (1944) wrote The Gasteromycetes of New Zealand and Australia, bringing together the taxonomy of all known sequestrate macrofungi in the region. By 1895 approximately 2000 species of fungi had been recorded from Australia, 32 of them sequestrate. Recent intensive efforts in limited habitats have expanded our knowledge considerably, with more than 600 new species of sequestrate fungi recorded over the past 7 years. Many more remain to be discovered in Australia and New Zealand and knowledge of their biology and ecology needs to be developed.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Forestry Sci Lab, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Lebel, T (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Lebel, Teresa/0000-0002-8592-1102",,,,117,8,9,0,9,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1030-1887,,,AUST SYST BOT,Aust.

Mycoflora, especially symbionts, has been reported to decrease 5-10 years before the forest community begins to decline. Mycological research can therefore be useful for forecasting the evolution of forests subject to man-made stress. Researchers in central Europe have found that the mycorrhizal ratio (percentage of mycorrhizal fungi with respect to all macromycetes) is a useful index of the level of forest pollution, being much lower in contaminated areas. Here, data on macromycetes of different forest ecosystems from central Italy were examined to determine whether this index is applicable to the Mediterranean area, and to determine whether factors other than atmospheric pollution could influence the mycorrhizal ratio in these situations. The results show that the percentage, and especially the number of mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly correlated with environmental parameters such as altitude, number of tree species and tree cover. It is concluded that in the Mediterranean area a low mycorrhizal ratio does not always indicate that a forest is subject to air pollution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The opposite is found with saprotrophic fungi. Several fungi appeared only in one forest type confirming the concept of early stage versus late stage fungi.

Non-mycorrhizal Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. + Picea glauca (Moench) Voss seedlings were planted across cut blocks of three sizes (0.1, 1.0, and 10 ha) and in the uncut forest. In 1996 and 1997, seedlings were harvested after 13 weeks and examined for mycorrhizae. In 1996, diversity and richness of ectomycorrhizal types were significantly greater at forest plots and at plots located 2 m from the forest edge as compared with plots located > 16 m into the cut block. In 1997, richness was again significantly reduced beyond 2 m. No differences in any of the diversity measures were detected between the different cut block sizes. The results of this study suggest that proximity to overstory trees may be more important than cut block size for patterns of ectomycorrhizal diversity and colonization. Additionally, polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used to assess the accuracy of morphotyping and, in some cases, to identify the associated fungus by comparison with RFLP patterns generated by sporocarps.","Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Hagerman, SM (reprint author), Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",smhagerm@okcins.okanagan.bc.ca,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184; Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126",,,,79,32,32,0,10,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Collembolans have often been credited with negatively affecting arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses, mainly by grazing and severing the associated external fungal network from host roots. However, most previous experiments were performed using relatively 'clean' systems where other, non-mycorrhizal, fungi were largely excluded. Yet, plant rhizospheres harbour a wide variety of highly palatable non-AM fungi, most of which have saprobic lifestyles. 2. In this study we isolated and cultured several rhizosphere fungi, and the collembolan, Folsomia candida, from the Long-Term Mycorrhiza Research Site, University of Guelph, Canada, to test the hypothesis that, given a choice, collembolans would prefer to feed on saprobic fungi and that such a choice is of adaptive significance to the animals. 3. A laboratory food preference experiment revealed that F. candida favours common saprobic fungi over a variety of AM fungi. Coincidentally, fecundity levels across two Folsomia generations were higher when animals fed exclusively on the preferred fungus, Alternaria alternata. When fed less palatable fungi, fecundity was greatly reduced; in fact animals from the F1 generation were unable to produce any eggs when placed on an exclusive diet of one of the following three AM fungi, Acaulospora spinosa, Scutellospora calospora and Gigaspora gigantea. 4. These results indicate that a strict diet of AM fungi by collembolans has reproductive consequences. Therefore, we propose that under natural conditions these animals spend more time feeding on common saprobic fungi rather than their AM counterparts. This suggests that previous 'clean' studies that investigated the interactions between collembolans and AM fungi may have reported exaggerated effects of animal grazing. The influence of collembolans on the functioning of AM symbioses, under more natural conditions, remains not well understood.","Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Klironomos, JN (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,30,65,70,3,33,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Poa annua (annual meadow-grass or annual bluegrass) is the most problematic weed of temperate zone golf putting greens. In the UK there are no chemicals approved for its control, although several herbicides and plant growth regulators are available in the USA. Reducing P. annua levels in fine turf would greatly reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides and water that currently exists. 2. This paper reports on an observational and a manipulative study in golf putting greens, aimed at determining whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have any potential for the reduction of this weed in fine turf. 3. All 18 greens on three golf courses were sampled, and in two courses a negative relation between AM fungi and P. annua abundance was found, upholding previous results. In greens where AM fungi were relatively common (as measured by root colonization), P. annua was rare, and vice versa. Furthermore, when the fungi were common, abundance of the desirable turfgrass Agrostis stolonifera was greater. 4. Two explanations are suggested for these relations, a competitive one, in which AM fungi alter the balance of competition between the two grasses, and an antagonistic one, in which the fungi may directly reduce the growth of P. annua. 5. In a manipulative experiment, where mycorrhizal inoculum was added to a golf green, the colonization level of A. stolonifera roots was enhanced, as was the abundance of this grass. Furthermore, there was a suggestion that adding inoculum could decrease the abundance of P. annua. 6. AM fungi have the potential to be a much more environmentally sound method of P. annua control in sports turf than the currently used chemicals.","Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England","Gange, AC (reprint author), Univ London Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",,,,,,,45,24,25,0,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The hypothesis was that the seedlings would be unable to acclimate beyond partially open conditions after canopy disturbance caused by logging, therefore limiting the potential for regeneration in the most open areas. Bleaching and reductions in the predawn ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m) indicated chronic photoinhibition and damage to the previously shade-adapted leaves of seedlings in an area logged 2 weeks earlier. The majority of seedlings in partially open and open environments of an area logged 3 months earlier were already growing fast. Leaves that had developed in the new environment showed only small reductions in predawn F-v/F-m and large increases in the light saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) per unit area when compared to shaded seedlings. Leaves in the most open environments had higher but more variable nitrogen concentrations, A(max) per unit area and A(max) per unit mass when compared to seedlings in partially open environments. Increases in dark respiration were disproportionately large compared to increases in A(max) and may have been the result of increased investment in photoprotective mechanisms. The response of stomatal conductance to the vapour pressure deficit and leaf temperature was examined, but it suggested only a 10% reduction in daily leaf level carbon gain in open environments. The ratio of leaf area to fine root mass was highest in shade-suppressed and newly exposed seedlings, suggesting a potential hydraulic limitation to transpiration during acclimation. However, rainfall during this period was high and leaf water potentials did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed environments. S. johorensis seedlings were capable of significant acclimation to conditions more extreme than partial canopy opening, Low seedling density after logging during the wet season cannot be explained by a limited potential for photosynthetic acclimation.","Univ Edinburgh, Inst Ecol & Resource Management, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, Midlothian, Scotland; PHT Kayu Mas, Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia; Forest Res Inst Samarinda, Kalimantan Timur, Indonesia","Clearwater, MJ (reprint author), Hawaii Agr Res Ctr, 99-193 Aiea Hts Dr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA.",,,"Clearwater, Michael/0000-0002-8563-0671",,,,53,17,19,0,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1999,121,4,,,,,478,488,,10.1007/s004420050954,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,273VJ,WOS:000084728300005,28308357,,,,10/31/19J,"de Varennes, A; Torres, MO",,,,"de Varennes, A; Torres, MO",,,Remediation of a long-term copper-contaminated soil using a polyacrylate polymer,SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,remediation; copper; polluted soils; polymers,ACCUMULATION; CADMIUM; METALS; PH,"We investigated whether a polyacrylate polymer could be used to remediate a soil which had been contaminated with copper for many years.

To compensate for the hazards of soil acidification large forest areas in North-Rhine-Westphalia have been limed since the early eighties, it has been feared that the root system of trees might degenerate into shallow rooting as a consequence of forest liming. This would have considerable, adverse effects on the stability of forest ecosystems. Up to date only a limited number of studies exist on the development of shallow rooting systems as a result of forest liming. For a better understanding of this problem, two root ditches each were excavated in a beech stand (130 to 150 years old) on a limed plot (1983 and 1990, 6 t/ha each) and an unlimed control plot. Root distribution, soil morphology and pH of soil suspension were recorded. The pH value of the soil suspension was significantly higher on the limed plot that on the control plot, even at a depth of 90 cms. Root distribution showed no significant differences. Merely a slight increase in finest roots (diameter 0-1 mm) was recorded on the limed plot at a depth of 70 to 90 cms. No correlation between soil pH and beech root distribution could be found. The study shows that, after 15 years' liming, the old beech trees on limed plots did nor develop a shallower root system than the trees on the control pier.","Landesamt Agrarordnung Nordrhein Westfalen, Landesanstalt Okol Bodenordnung & Forsten, D-45610 Recklinghausen, Germany","Asche, N (reprint author), Landesamt Agrarordnung Nordrhein Westfalen, Landesanstalt Okol Bodenordnung & Forsten, Postfach 10 10 52, D-45610 Recklinghausen, Germany.",,,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0015-8003,,,FORSTWISS CENTRALBL,Forstwiss.

Thirty-seven fungal species were distinguished by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs); most were identified to species level by sporocarp RFLP matches or to genus/family level by using sequence databases for the mitochondrial and nuclear large-subunit rRNA genes. The below-ground fungal community found in the mature forest contrasted markedly with the resistant propagule community, as only four species were found in both communities. The dominant species in the mature forest were members of the Russulaceae, Thelephorales and Amanitaceae. In contrast, the resistant propagule community was dominated by Rhizopogon species and by species of the Ascomycota. Only one species, Tomentella sublilacina (Thelephorales), was common in both communities. The spatial distribution of mycorrhizae on mature roots and propagules in the soil differed among the dominant species, For example, T. sublilacina mycorrhizae exhibited a unique bias toward the organic horizons, Russula brevipes mycorrhizae were denser and more clumped than those of other species and Cenococcum propagules were localized, whereas R. subcaerulescens propagules were evenly distributed. We suggest that species differences in resource preferences and colonization strategies, such as those documented here, contribute to the maintenance of species richness in the ectomycorrhizal community.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Taylor, DL (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019","Taylor, Donald/0000-0002-5985-9210",,,,49,274,286,1,86,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass) was grown in pH(Ca) 4 and 5 (soil:10 mM CaCl(2), 1:1) soil (typic Hapludult) inoculated with eight isolates of AMF [Glomus (G.) clarum, G. diaphanum, G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, Gigaspora (Gi.) albida, Gi. margarita, Gi. rosea and Acaulospora (A.) morrowiae] to determine the effects of these isolates on plant growth and root colonization. Compared to nonmycorrhizal (nonAMF) plants, mycorrhizal (AMF) plants had as high as 52-fold increases in dry matter (DM) in pH(Ca) 4 soil and as high as 26-fold increases in DM in pH(Ca) 5 soil; G. clarum and G. diaphanum plants had the highest DM and Gi. rosea plants had the lowest DM. The AMF plants grown in pH(Ca) 4 soil had higher DM than in pH(Ca) 5 soil. Root DM decreased more than shoot DM for plants grown in pH(Ca) 5 compared to pH(Ca) 4 soil, which was reflected in shoot-to-root DM ratio changes. Total root length (RL) was similar for plants grown in pH(Ca) 4 and 5 soil and varied considerably depending on AMF isolate. Specific RL was higher for AMF plants grown in pH(Ca) 5 than in pH(Ca) 4 soil. Root colonization [determined as vesicles or arbuscules in root cells (VA), roots with hyphal infections (HI) and total colonization (VA or HI)] varied extensively with AMF isolate. Although percentage root colonization was not directly related to amount of DM, good enhancement of DM did not occur unless total colonization was >20%. Some AMF isolates were highly effective in overcoming acidic soil constraints and good growth of switchgrass in acidic soil may depend on root-AMF symbiosis.

Two months before sowing, half of each plot man applied with dazomet to prevent the formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). The biomass of different groups of micro-organisms was estimated 28, 51 and 72 d after sowing based on amounts of certain fatty acids extracted from the soil. Dazomet application strongly suppressed colonisation of the linseed roots by AM fungi throughout the experiment. In plots with no dazomet application, root colonisation by the AM fungi increased from harvests 1 to 3 as judged both from microscopical estimates and from quantitative analysis of the AM fungal indicative fatty acid 16.1 omega 5. These methods also revealed that AM formation was reduced in P-fertilised plots. The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) 16:1 omega 5 decreased in dazomet-treated soil, and it was assumed that the PLFA 16:1 omega 5 remaining in treated soil originated from bacteria. The biomass of the extraradical AM mycelium could then be estimated by multiplying the difference in PLFA 16:1 omega 5 between dazomet treated and nontreated soils by a conversion factor. This calculation indicated that the biomass of the extraradical mycelium of AM fungi was about 10 times as high as the biomass of intraradical mycelium and that the extraradical mycelium constituted the largest fraction of the soil microbial biomass. Dazomet application also decreased the biomass of saprophytic fungi in the soil as indicated by the amount of PLFA 18:2 omega 6,9, while analyses of bacteria-specific fatty acids indicated that the bacterial biomass in the soil was not affected by either dazomet or P application.

Although important progress has been made in modelling photosynthesis, less effort has been spent on understanding the carbon allocation, especially at large spatial scales. Whereas several individual-level models of plant growth include an allocation scheme, most global terrestrial models still assume constant allocation of net primary production (NPP) among plant parts, without any environmental coupling. Here, we use the CASA biosphere model as a platform for exploring a new global allocation scheme that estimates allocation of photosynthesis products among leaves, stems, and roots depending on resource availability. The philosophy underlying the model is that-allocation patterns result from evolved responses that adjust carbon investments to facilitate capture of the most limiting resources, i.e. light, water, and mineral nitrogen. In addition, we allow allocation of NPP to vary in response to changes in atmospheric CO2. The relative magnitudes of changes in NPP and resource-use efficiency control the response of root:shoot allocation. For ambient CO2, the model produces realistic changes in above-ground allocation along productivity gradients. In comparison to the CASA standard estimate using fixed allocation ratios, the new allocation scheme tends to favour root allocation, leading to a 10% lower global biomass. Elevated CO2, which alters the balance between growth and available resources, generally leads to reduced water stress and consequently, decreased root:shoot ratio. The major exception is forest ecosystems, where increased nitrogen stress induces a larger root allocation.","Columbia Univ, Goddard Inst Space Studies, New York, NY 10025 USA; Ctr Etud Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; Carnegie Inst Washington, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada","Friedlingstein, P (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Goddard Inst Space Studies, 2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA.",,"Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014","Friedlingstein, Pierre/0000-0003-3309-4739",,,,101,208,225,1,52,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

This ratio depends to a large extent on the amount and spatial distribution of soil moisture that is available to plants, and these variables, in turn, are determined primarily by climate and land use. Current conceptual models for determining the ratio of herbaceous to woody plant biomass in semiarid plant communities are based either on differences in soil moisture with depth (vertical heterogeneity) from one site to another (Walter's two-layer model) or on differences in soil moisture between canopy and intercanopy patches at the same site (horizontal heterogeneity) that result from disturbances associated with land use (Schlesinger et al.'s model of desertification). We developed a model that unifies these two perspectives by relaxing two assumptions of Walter's two-layer model. First, our model recognizes that soil moisture varies horizontally between canopy and intercanopy patches, not only due to land-use disturbance, a general assumption of the Schlesinger et al. model, but also due to the physical nature of the canopy itself. Second, while retaining the general assumption of Walter that woody plants obtain moisture from deeper soil layers than do herbaceous plants, our model recognizes the existence of two types of woody plants: those that extract a substantial proportion of their moisture from deeper layers and those that extract mainly from shallower layers. By modifying the two-layer hypothesis to include four soil compartments and distinguishing between shallow- and deeper-rooted woody species, our model integrates three key concepts in semiarid ecology: (1) the proportion of woody cover increases as moisture in the deeper soil layers increases (Walter's two-layer hypothesis for coexistence of herbaceous and woody plants); (2) land use practices that cause a reduction in herbaceous vegetation and compaction of intercanopy soils lead to a long-term increase in the proportion of woody plants (Schlesinger et al.'s concept, or more generally, that at a given site multiple variations in the proportions of herbaceous and woody plant biomass are possible); and (3) changes in the ratios of herbaceous to woody plant biomass exhibit complex behavior (changes can happen quickly and are not directly reversible without intensive management). This integration of concepts results because rather than assuming a simple, one-way dependence of plant functional types on soil moisture heterogeneity, our model assumes an interdependence between the two: soil moisture heterogeneity constrains the composition of the plant community, which in turn modifies soil moisture heterogeneity. The four-compartment model that we propose enables, for the first time, an integrated picture of both dimensions of soil moisture heterogeneity - horizontal and vertical - and of the interdependence between soil moisture heterogeneity and the proportions of the plant functional types that make up a given plant community. This unified conceptual model can be applied to provide insight into the individual and the combined effects of climate and land use on semiarid plant communities within the grassland/forest continuum, which vary in the proportions of canopy and intercanopy patches.","Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Environm Sci Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Breshears, DD (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Alamos Natl Lab, Environm Sci Grp, Mail Stop J495, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",,"Breshears, David D./B-9318-2009","Breshears, David D./0000-0001-6601-0058",,,,84,155,179,6,103,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

It is unknown whether this specialization varies geographically or is influenced by the environment. We have investigated these questions in the nonphotosynthetic orchids Corallorhiza maculata and C. mertensiana by amplifying fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragments from widespread mycorrhiza samples and then discriminating putative fungal species using ITS restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Three fungal species were found across 27 plants representing seven populations of C. mertensiana; 20 species were found across 104 plants and 21 populations of C. maculata. All fungi belonged to the Russulaceae, an ectomycorrhizal family. Partitioning of Simpson's diversity showed that 48% of the variance in occurrences of fungal species coincided with population boundaries in C. mertensiana, vs. 68% in C. maculata. This differentiation coincided with geography but not habitat in C. mertensiana. In contrast, likelihood ratio tests showed strong associations between fungal occurrence and both habitat and phenotype in C. maculata. For example, C. maculata populations growing under oaks had no fungi in common with nearby populations growing under conifers, and those above 2000 m had no fungi in common with those below 2000 m. However, plant genetic differentiation may underlie some of these patterns. C. mertensiana and C. maculata never shared fungal species, even when growing intermixed at the same site, demonstrating genetic control that was independent of habitat. Similarly, intermixed normal and pale-coloured variants of C. maculata had no fungal species in common. These results demonstrate fine-scale genetic influences and geographical mosaicism in a mycorrhizal interaction.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Taylor, DL (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,"Taylor, Lee/V-1921-2019","Taylor, Donald/0000-0002-5985-9210",,,,90,110,123,0,21,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

As resource availability to plants is influenced by the architecture of decomposer food webs, it has been hypothesised that the diversity of decomposers can also control ecosystem processes, including primary production. We manipulated the complexity of soil animal communities in a miniecosystem experiment in which a boreal forest floor with birch seedlings infected with mycorrhizal fungi was created. The soil animal diversity ranged from zero to typical species richness of soil fauna (approximately 50 taxa) in coniferous forests. Between these extremes was a nested factorial design with manually assembled communities consisting of two sets of one-species, and two sets of five-species animal communities within Fungivorous and microbi-detritivorous trophic groups. To investigate the role of predators in system functioning, the miniecosystems with fungivorous and microbidetritivorous fauna were established either with or without mesostigmatid mites as top predators. The miniecosystems were incubated in a climate chamber with varying illumination and temperature regimes for 40 weeks. Our experiment provides evidence that primary productivity is generally insensitive to variation at the species level or even at the level of trophic groups. Although top predators generally reduced prey population size, no effect was found on system functioning. However; the removal of microbe- or detritus-feeding fauna, especially the microbi-detritivore Cognettia sphagnetorum reduced plant N uptake and accumulation of plant biomass. The functional importance of soil fauna was inversely related to the trophic position of the group. Our results suggest that ecosystem functioning is robust against species extinctions in belowground food webs, and that primary production is predominantly controlled by organisms at low trophic positions in the decomposer food web.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Laakso, J (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,"Setala, Heikki M/P-7354-2015",,,,,37,192,207,0,77,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,57,64,,10.2307/3546996,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hodge, A; Stewart, J; Robinson, D; Griffiths, BS; Fitter, AH",,,,"Hodge, A; Stewart, J; Robinson, D; Griffiths, BS; Fitter, AH",,,"Plant, soil fauna and microbial responses to N-rich organic patches of contrasting temporal availability",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,decomposition; Lolium perenne; N capture; organic patch/pulse; microorganisms,AMINO-ACIDS; FINE ROOTS; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION; NATURAL CONDITIONS; FEEDING NEMATODES; FIELD CONDITIONS; LEGUME RESIDUES; PATTERNS; PROTOZOA,"A simple (L-lysine) N-15/C-13 dual-labelled organic patch was added to soil microcosm units with or without Lolium perenne L. plants either as a single addition of 5 mi of 200 mM L-lysine ('patch' treatment) or as a series of 1 mi aliquots of 200 mM L-lysine added at 7 day intervals over 28 days ('pulse' treatment) thus both treatments supplied the same amount of nitrogen (N), Controls were added as 1 mi H2O over 28 days (control pulse treatment) or as a single addition of 5 mi H2O (control patch treatment) to planted tubes. Decomposition of the added L-lysine was rapid as shown by amounts of C-13 detected in the soil atmosphere and were greatest from the planted L-lysine pulse treatment indicating the presence of plant roots was influencing decomposition of the pulse. Plant uptake of N, as N-15, from the added L-lysine was also rapid and detected in the shoots by day 4, However, the mean rate at which N-15 appeared in the shoots did not differ between patch or pulse treatments. No C-13 levels greater than background were detected in the plant material. Root production and mortality in the patch or pulse addition zone was measured in situ using minirhizotron tubes. Cumulative root births in the L-lysine patch treatment were greater than controls in the latter part of the experiment while instantaneous root births were greater in the L-lysine pulse treatment compared to all others at 21 d. Root death rate was faster in the L-lysine treatments than in the controls. Root and shoot dry weights at final harvest (35 d) were greater in the pulse treatments. Shoot, but not root, dry weights were also significantly greater in the L-Lysine treatments compared to controls. Total root and shoot nitrogen contents were greater in the L-lysine treatments than controls. Total N capture by the L, perenne plants from the added L-lysine was 57% (patch) and 61% (pulse) of the N added and did not differ significantly between treatments. Protozoan biomass measured at harvest was greater in the L-lysine treatments (planted and unplanted) than the planted controls. The physiological profile of the microbial community did not vary because of patch or pulse treatments although significant differences between planted and unplanted L-lysine treatments and planted and H2O controls occurred. The response of roots and microorganisms in relation to N capture is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We also determined ectomycorrhizal diversity on Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. seedlings 2 years after outplanting. Ectomycorrhizal fungal richness, based on epigeous sporocarps, decreased exponentially as gap size increased. There were sporocarps of 15 species along 475 m of transect in gaps larger than 900 m(2), which was approximately 13% of the number of species present in neighboring forests (115 species along 300 m of transect). These data have implications for foresters who would be interested in managing forests for both timber and edible mushroom harvesting. Ectomycorrhizal richness on seedlings decreased slightly at increasing distances from the edge of the intact forest. The maximum richness was found at 7 m or less from the forest edge for both tree species. The decrease in richness with distance from the forest was associated with an increase in the proportion of Thelephora mycorrhizae in the samples. The number of types of ectomycorrhizae on root systems and the number of species producing epigeous sporocarps were not correlated. These results confirm the importance of sampling both sporocarps and root tips to achieve an accurate estimate of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community in forest ecosystems.","Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada; Minist Forests, Smithers, BC V0J 2N0, Canada","Durall, DM (reprint author), Okanagan Univ Coll, Dept Biol, 3333 Coll Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",,"Jones, melanie/A-5011-2012","Jones, melanie/0000-0001-5784-5184",,,,46,54,58,2,24,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Water uptake from deep soil layers has been found to contribute significantly to the dry season transpiration at some sites in Amazonia and it has been estimated that large parts of the evergreen forests in Amazonia depend on deep roots to survive the dry season. Thus, the presence of deep roots might provide a significant source of atmospheric moisture during the dry season, and one which would be affected by deforestation. We investigate the role of deep-rooted vegetation and its removal in the context of Amazonian deforestation using an atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM). A distribution of deep roots is obtained by a numerical optimization approach. The simulated climate with the use of the calculated deep roots substantially improves the seasonal characteristics of the GCM. Three additional simulations are then conducted in order to isolate the effect of rooting depth reduction from other parameter changes associated with large-scale deforestation. Most of the climatic effects occur during the dry season and are attributed to the reduction of rooting depth. Dry periods are found to last longer, being more intense with drier and warmer air, while the wet season remains fairly unchanged. The implications of these climatic effects for the re-establishment of the natural evergreen forest are discussed.","Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Kleidon, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016; Kleidon, Axel/O-7843-2014","Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Kleidon, Axel/0000-0002-3798-0730",,,,28,25,27,1,11,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-7447,,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) was used to measure changes in the soil's volumetric water content, and heat-pulse was used to monitor locally the rates of sap flow in the trunk and roots of the tree. We also measured the tree's distribution of root-length density and obtained supporting data to characterize the soil's hydraulic properties. The experimental data were used to examine the output of the WAVE-model (Vanclooster et al, 1995; Ecol. Model. 81, 183-185) in which soil water transport is predicted using Richards' equation, and where root uptake is represented by a distributed macroscopic sink term. When the surface soil layers were uniformly wet, 70% of the trees water uptake occurred in the top 0.4 m of the root zone, in which approximately 70% of the tree's fine roots were located. When a partial irrigation was applied to just one side of the root zone, the apple tree quickly shifted its pattern of water uptake with an almost twofold increase in uptake from the wetter soil parts and a corresponding reduction in uptake from the drier parts. The response of root-sap flow to irrigation was almost immediate (i.e. root flow increased within hours of the irrigation). Following subsequent irrigations over the whole soil surface, TDR measurements revealed a surface-ward shift in the pattern of water extraction, and root flow measurements revealed a recovery in the uptake function of seemingly inactive roots located in the previously-dry soil. Via our root sap flow measurements, we observed two roots on the same tree locally responding quite differently to similar events of soil wetting. This observation suggests that there may be considerable functional variability across the apple root system. Our measurement-model calculations yielded similar results and stress the prime role played by the plant in modifying the root zone balance of water. Following an irrigation or rainfall event, root uptake by apple appears to be more dependent upon the near-surface availability of water than it is related to the distribution of fine roots.","Inst Hort Res, Environm & Risk Management Grp, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Green, S (reprint author), Inst Hort Res, Environm & Risk Management Grp, Private Bag 11-030, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",greens@hort.cri.nz,"Green, Steve/I-3938-2013; Clothier, Brent E/H-3124-2013","Green, Steve/0000-0002-4020-3430; Clothier, Brent E/0000-0003-1901-0324",,,,35,90,109,5,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,SEP,1999,206,1,,,,,61,77,,,,,17,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,194DK,WOS:000080176700007,,,,,10/31/19J,"Lodeiro, AR; Favelukes, G",,,,"Lodeiro, AR; Favelukes, G",,,Early interactions of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and soybean roots: specificity in the process of adsorption,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,adsorption; Bradyrhizobium japonicum; lectin; soybean; symbiotic recognition,CARBOHYDRATE-BINDING ACTIVITIES; RHIZOBIUM-MELILOTI; CLOVER SYMBIOSIS; LECTIN; ATTACHMENT; INHIBITION; BACTERIA; BJ38,"Specificity in the process of adsorption of Bradyrhizobium japonicum to soybean roots (Glycine mns (L.) Merr.) was studied with a standardized procedure that quantifies adsorbed rhizobia to young seedlings from dilute suspensions (in the order of 10(3) bacteria ml(-1)) of an antibiotic-resistant strain of B. japonicum. Adsorption of this strain was maximal in the late-exponential growth phase. Adsorption was rapid, without an initial lag, and slowed down after 1 h, approaching a plateau after 4 h. This occurred either in absence or presence of Ca2+ plus Mg2+ ions. Adsorption of the antibiotic-resistant strain at a constant concentration of 10(3) rhizobia ml(-1) was increasingly inhibited by the presence of antibiotic-sensitive competitor rhizobia at a concentration ranging from 10(3) to 10(8) bacteria ml(-1). In the range of 10(5)-10(7) competitor rhizobia ml(-1), a heterologous competitor inhibited adsorption of the antibiotic-resistant strain significantly less than a homologous competitor, indicating the occurrence of symbiont-specific adsorption events. Evidence of adsorption specificity also was shown by competition against a range of heterologous and homologous strains. Specific adsorption did not require the presence of Ca2+ plus Mg2+ ions. By incubating B. japonicum with soybean roots in the presence of a heterologous competitor strain and different concentrations of either N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (the soybean lectin hapten), or lactose (the B. japonicum BJ38 lectin inducer and hapten), it was observed that whereas N-acetyl-D-galactosamine had no effect on specific adsorption, lactose at 0.1 mM stimulated specific adsorption by 105%, and at 10.0 mM inhibited it by 65%.

Three microcosms were amended with 6000 mg zinc kg(-1), a concentration chosen to approximate the quantities of total zinc found at a contaminated field site. Three control microcosms received no zinc amendment. Three pH control microcosms received H2SO4, adequate to result in the same pH decrease as occurred in the zinc amended soil. Mean soluble zinc contents were 4660 mg kg(-1) (amended soils), 1.08 mg kg(-1) (unamended soils), and 2.10 mg kg(-1) (pH adjusted soils). Biological community assessments included culturable bacteria (plate counts), microbial biomass (chloroform fumigation), dehydrogenase activity; proportion of zinc resistant bacteria (plate counts on zinc amended agar), and changes in community structure (BIOLOG and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis). After 15 d of incubation, zinc amendment resulted in an 87% decrease in viable counts and a 47% decrease in microbial biomass. Dehydrogenase activity decreased by 95%, and the proportion of zinc resistant bacteria increased from 0.08% to 0.75%. Microbial community structure alteration resulting from zinc amendment was indicated by shifts in both BIOLOG metabolic profiles and PLFA profiles. Effects of zinc on PLFA profiles included relative decreases in indicator fatty acids for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Some adaptation of the microbial communities to the zinc amendment was suggested by the fact that after 420 d incubation there were no significant differences in culturable bacterial populations or microbial biomass of the control and zinc amended systems. However, other microbial properties measured in this study showed that zinc still affected microbial community structure and activity after 420 d. Dehydrogenase activity of the zinc treated communities remained 93% lower than the controls. The percentage of zinc resistant populations was still significantly higher for the zinc treated communities. Similarly, the BIOLOG and PLFA profiles continued to show differences in the structure of the zinc treated and control microbial communities. Effects of zinc on PLEA profiles at day 420 included a relative decrease in an indicator fatty acid for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and a relative increase in an indicator fatty acid for fungi. The comparison of PLEA profiles also showed mixed results for several fatty acid indicators for actinomycetes. The pH control treatment showed similar effects on population size and activity as the zinc treatment, although in most cases there was a much stronger effect with the zinc treatment. In addition, the pH treatment caused changes in BIOLOG and PLEA profiles which were different than the changes seen with zinc treatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These differences were observed in the nodules formed on both primary and lateral roots. With a lower inoculation dose of rhizobia (10(2) and 10(5) cells per pot), Kitamusume formed a smaller number of larger nodules than Toyosuzu inoculated with 108-109 cells per pot. This result indicated that the number of nodules was the factor directly controlled by host, because the size of the nodules was not determined by the genetic background, but changed depending on the number of nodules formed. The number of the first order lateral roots of 21 d old Kitamusume was 1.49 times larger than that of Toyosuzu. The relationship between the number of nodules and the number of first order lateral roots of 14 cultivars showed a significant positive correlation, These results indicated that the formation of nodules and lateral roots may be similarly controlled by a certain factor in different cultivars.","Tohoku Natl Agr Expt Stn, Morioka, Iwate 0200123, Japan","Ikeda, J (reprint author), Hokkaido Natl Agr Expt Stn, Memuro 0820071, Japan.",,,,,,,19,5,5,0,0,JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION,TOKYO,"BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",0038-0768,,,SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR,Soil Sci.

The Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility in the Duke University Forest (NC) fumigates plots of an undisturbed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest with CO2 that is strongly depleted in C-13. This labeled CO2 is found in the soil pore space through live root and mycorrhizal respiration and soil heterotroph respiration of labile root exudates. By measuring the depletion of (CO2)-C-13 in the soil system, we found that the rhizosphere contribution to soil CO2 reflected the distribution of fine roots in the soil and that late in the growing season roots contributed 55% of total soil respiration at the surface, This estimate may represent an upper limit on the contribution of roots to soil respiration because high atmospheric CO2 often increases in root density and/or root activity in the soil.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Boston Coll, Dept Geol & Geophys, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Andrews, JA (reprint author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, MS 170,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",,,"Harrison, Kevin/0000-0002-6921-7203",,,,38,179,199,4,79,SOIL SCI SOC AMER,MADISON,"677 SOUTH SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0361-5995,,,SOIL SCI SOC AM J,Soil Sci.

Treatments consisted in combining stock type with three different height to diameter ratios, storage duration and method (long at 2 degrees C or short in various conditions), and protection from desiccation (by bagging or not). Seedling lots were assessed at planting by root electrolyte leakage (REL), root moisture content (RMC) and predawn shoot water potential (psi(wp)) They were planted simultaneously in well-watered or water-stressed conditions. Performance level was based on survival and height growth at the end of the growing season. Slender seedlings not bagged had the lowest values of RMC, psi(wp) and field performance. The sturdier stock type was less sensitive to desiccation and had 100 % survival, in all stress conditions. In contrast to RMC and psi(wp) REL was not influenced by stock type. RMC and psi(wp) values were highly correlated, on a seedling basis as on a batch basis. RMC was the best predictor of the field performance parameters (survival and growth for both water regimes) which were all well correlated. Moreover, lower stock quality resulted mainly in slower growth in the well-watered field trial, and in poor survival under drought conditions.

The C-mic to organic C ratio was 1.4% in the L+F+H horizon, and the ratio increased with increasing depth to 4.1% in the C horizon, which indicated that microbes in the deeper soil horizons decomposed recently deposited root litter or exudates. The storage of carbon in fine roots was four times more than that in C-mic.

Damage to the meristems of spruce trees have been found for several ozone treatments, in the form of an enhanced number or chromosomal aberrations, which appeared to be persistent for up to 2 years after the ozone challenge. One of the main aims of the present study was to determine whether a moderate ozone concentration is able to induce damage in needle biochemistry and/or only in the genetic material of root meristems. In the experiment three different clones of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) were challenged with moderate ozone concentrations (up to SO nl/l) for 11 weeks in greenhouses. Simultaneous investigations of root rip meristematic cells and the biochemical status of needle tissues regarding antioxidants and pigments were performed at two different sampling rimes: directly after the ozone treatment and 1 year later. Ozone effects in needles were absent both at the end of the fumigation and also after 1 year, but different clonal behaviour was found. Effect of ozone on chromosomal aberration rates in root tip meristems were observed and also the types of persisting chromosomal aberrations changed within the time course and within the different clones.","Graz Univ, Inst Plant Physiol, A-8010 Graz, Austria; Austrian Res Ctr Siebersdorf, A-2444 Seibersdorf, Austria","Wonisch, A (reprint author), Graz Univ, Inst Plant Physiol, Schubertstr 51, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",,"Tausz, Michael/C-1990-2013; Soja, Gerhard/A-9657-2008","Tausz, Michael/0000-0001-8205-8561; Soja, Gerhard/0000-0001-7391-4899; Muller, Maria/0000-0003-2791-0381",,,,36,11,11,0,0,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0300-1237,,,EUR J FOREST PATHOL,Eur.

Half of the soil derived from each area was microwaved to reduce soil fungi, resulting in four different 'soil types'. 2 Chamaecrista fasciculata plants were smaller when grown in their native soil vs. that from under A. gerardii, but were unaffected by microwaving (i.e. fungal reduction). Andropogon gerardii plants were shorter with fewer inflorescences in non-microwaved soil, with the poorest growth occurring in Iron-microwaved C. fasciculata soil. 3 Fungi were isolated from roots of A. gerardii growing in the different soil types. We tested whether the fungi found differed between the four soil types and whether any species characteristic of C. fasciculata soil were responsible for the poor growth of A. gerardii in this medium. 4 Fungi unique to the non-microwaved C, fasciculata soil type reduced tillering and caused an early reduction in growth of A. gerardii. These effects were partially ameliorated when potentially mycoparasitic fungi associated with A. gerardii were also included. By the end of the experiment, both fungal treatments increased above-ground biomass but greatly reduced below-ground biomass of A. gerardii compared with controls, suggesting that the exposure to potential fungal pathogens from C, fasciculata soil altered biomass allocation within plants. 5 There was no evidence of negative feedback between the prairie species and their own soils. However, fungi associated with Chamaecrista fasciculata were detrimental to A. gerardii, one of the dominant perennials in the surrounding area, and may facilitate the annual's long-term persistence. Arbuscular mycorrhizae did not ameliorate the pathogenic effects of these fungi as there was little colonization of A. gerardii roots in C. fasciculata soil.","Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Holah, JC (reprint author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,50,48,52,0,33,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Instead of calculated rooting depths the following generalized values proved to be acceptable in water supply and distribution as well as in plant cultivation: 4 dm for grassland (meadow and pasture) 10 dm for arable land (without special cultures) 15 dm for forests and woodland.

The ability of three species of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus etunicatum, Acaulespora denticulata, Scutellospora calospora) infecting Plantago lanceolata roots to further colonize neighbouring plants was measured in response to the distance between root systems and the presence of the collembolan, Folsomia candida. In the absence of collembola, all three fungal species infected neighbouring plants in two weeks or less (at short distances), but were not successful when neighbouring plants were placed 45 cm away or further. Colonization by G. etunicatum was the quickest at short distances, but S. calospora showed greatest ability to colonize at increasing distance,whereas A. denticulata was intermediate. In the presence of the collembolan, G. etunicatum took longer to colonize neighbouring plants, but was able to infect at least 30 cm further, illustrating the arthropod's ability to disperse the AM inoculum. A. denticulata increased its range by 10 cm in the presence of F. candida, but unlike C. etunicatum, there was no delay in the colonization. In contrast, colonization of neighbouring plants by S. calospora was negatively affected both in terms of overall distance and time. These data support the hypothesis that soil arthropods can act as dispersal agents for AM inoculum, but the extent of this is fungal species-specific.","Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Premier Tech, Riviere Du Loop, PQ G5R 4C9, Canada","Klironomos, JN (reprint author), Univ Guelph, Dept Bot, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",,,,,,,34,56,57,1,34,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0178-2762,,,BIOL FERT SOILS,Biol.

The potential of concomitant changes in forest soil C stocks are not accounted for in the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. We developed a model-based approach to address this problem and assess the role of soils in forest C balance in the European Alps. The decomposition model FORCLIM-D was driven by long-term (that is, 1900-1985 AD) litter input scenarios constructed from forest inventory data, region-specific dendrochronological basal area indices, and time series of anthropogenic litter removal. The effect of spatial climate variability on organic matter decomposition across the case study region (Switzerland) was explicitly accounted for by constant long-term annual means of actual evapotranspiration and temperature. Uncertainties in forest development, litter removal, fine root litter input, and dynamics of forest soil C were studied by an explorative factorial sensitivity analysis. We found that forest soils contribute substantially to the biospheric C sequestration for Switzerland: Our ""best estimate"" yielded an increase of 0.35 Mt C/y or 0.33 t C/(ha y) in forest soils for 1985, that is, 27% of the C sequestered by forest trees (BUWAL 1994). Uncertainties regarding C accumulation in forest soils were substantial (0.11-0.58 Mt C/y) but could be reduced by estimating forest soil C stocks in the future. Whereas soils can be important for the C balance in naturally regrowing forests, their C sequestration is negligible (less than 5%) relative to anthropogenic CO(2) emissions in Western Europe at present.","Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","Perruchoud, D (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",perruchoud@wsl.ch,"Kienast, Felix/L-3536-2013","Kienast, Felix/0000-0002-3812-3124",,,,93,44,45,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,JUL-AUG,1999,2,4,,,,,320,337,,10.1007/s100219900083,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,227BG,WOS:000082057600010,,Green Accepted,,,10/31/19J,"Nilsson, MC; Wardle, DA; Dahlberg, A",,,,"Nilsson, MC; Wardle, DA; Dahlberg, A",,,Effects of plant litter species composition and diversity on the boreal forest plant-soil system,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMPETRUM-HERMAPHRODITUM; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; BATATASIN-III; DECAY-RATES; BIODIVERSITY; NITROGEN; ESTABLISHMENT; MIXTURES; LEAVES,"Although most plant products eventually enter the below-ground subsystem as plant litter, relatively little is known about the effects of plant litter diversity or composition on ecosystem processes and no study has considered the responses of plant growth to these factors. We conducted an experiment in which humus substrate was collected from three field sites in the boreal forest of northern Sweden. Litter was then placed on the humus surface and the litter used consisted of monocultures of Empetrum hermaphroditum (dwarf shrub), Betula pendula (tree), and Pleurozium schreberi (feather moss), as well as mixtures containing all the possible (two-way and three-way) combinations of these species; the experiment was maintained in out-door conditions. Although decomposition rates of this surface-placed litter differed between species few effects of litter mixing on litter mass loss were apparent. Added litter of Pinus sylvestris litter broke down most slowly when placed in E. hermaphroditum litter but sometimes showed elevated decomposition rates when placed in some of the multiple species litter mixes. Soil microbial biomass and activity was lowest when plant litter was absent, but as long as plant litter was present on the humus surface the species composition and diversify of the litter was irrelevant. There were Few effects of litter treatments on growth of seedlings of either B. pendula or P. sylvestris,is planted into the humus. However, for one site there were significant effects of mixing litter of P. schreberi and E. hermaphroditum in reducing growth of both seedling species. Litter treatments generally did not alter the competitive balance between B. pendula and P. sylvestris is seedlings when grown together but for all sites litter treatments had significant effects on the overall intensity of competition, and mixing of litter of B. pendula and P. schreberi had significant non-additive effects on competition intensity for two of the three sites. The abundance of mycorrhizae on seedlings was only weakly related to litter treatment but there were some positive effects of litter mixing on one of the most abundant mycorrhizal morphotypes on both species of seedlings for one of the sites. Our results suggest that litter presence was important in influencing a range of above ground and below ground properties and processes. In some instances individual species effects and litter mixing effects were also important but few general patterns emerged, and the nature of significant effects tended to be idiosyncratic. Ultimately our results show that plant litter has important ""afterlife effects"" which need to be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystems.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Nilsson, MC (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017; Collison, Elizabeth/F-6146-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; ",,,,45,89,102,4,64,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,1999,86,1,,,,,16,26,,10.2307/3546566,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,213HR,WOS:000081267100002,,,,,10/31/19J,"Koskela, J; Hari, P; Pipatwattanakul, D",,,,"Koskela, J; Hari, P; Pipatwattanakul, D",,,Analysis of gas exchange of Merkus pine populations by the optimality approach,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,grass stage; leaf conductance; optimal stomatal regulation; photosynthesis; Pinus merkusii; transpiration,DROUGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH,"We hypothesized that northern and northeastern Thai populations of Merkus pine (Pinus merkusii Jungh. et de Vriese), which differ in the duration of their grass stage and which originate from slightly different climates in terms of water availability differ in their gas exchange characteristics. We compared CO2 exchange response to irradiance, diurnal regulation of leaf conductance within a 10-day period and structural properties among the populations. We used a model, which is based on the concept of optimal stomatal regulation, to analyze CO2 exchange and transpiration rates. The two geographical groups did not differ in CO2 exchange response to irradiance, diurnal transpiration, or water use. Mean stomatal length was significantly greater in the northeastern population than in the northern populations, but stomatal frequency did not differ among populations. First-year shoot growth and dry matter production, allocation of nitrogen to needles and root:shoot ratios were similar in the two geographical groups. Genotypic variation in the duration of the grass stage was not reflected in variation in gas exchange, indicating that the grass stage is an adaptation to more site-specific conditions. The modeled response of CO2 exchange rates to irradiance fitted well the rates measured under laboratory conditions. The transpiration model, which utilized maximum leaf conductance and other parameters derived from the CO2 exchange measurements, also fitted well the transpiration rates measured in a greenhouse under changing environmental conditions.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol Trop Silviculture, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Kasetsart Univ, Fac Forestry, Dept Silviculture, Bangkok 10900, Thailand","Koskela, J (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Ecol Trop Silviculture, POB 28,Koetilantie 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,,,,,30,7,8,0,1,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,JUL,1999,19,8,,,,,511,518,,,,,8,Forestry,Forestry,205QZ,WOS:000080833200004,12651541,,,,10/31/19J,"McDowell, NG; Marshall, JD; Qi, JG; Mattson, K",,,,"McDowell, NG; Marshall, JD; Qi, JG; Mattson, K",,,Direct inhibition of maintenance respiration in western hemlock roots exposed to ambient soil carbon dioxide concentrations,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,maintenance respiration; Pinaceae; root respiration; Tsuga heterophylla,FINE-ROOT; CYANIDE-RESISTANT; CO2 CONCENTRATION; GROWTH; PLANTS; FOREST; O2; TEMPERATURE; SEEDLINGS; NORTHERN,"Root respiration often exhibits a direct and immediate decline with increasing concentrations of ambient soil carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), and recent evidence suggests this decline may be attributable to a decline in maintenance respiration within the root.

To test the hypothesis that maintenance respiration exhibits a direct, negative response to increasing [CO2], we measured total respiration in intact root systems of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) seedlings grown at different relative growth rates and exposed to soil [CO2]s ranging from 91 to 7008 mu mol mol(-1). Analysis of covariance was used to separate maintenance from total respiration. Total respiration declined exponentially with increasing [CO2]. Maintenance respiration, which comprised 85% of total respiration over all treatments, also declined exponentially with increasing [CO2]. Growth respiration was not inhibited at any [CO2].

Morphological measurements, moisture content and root electrolyte leakage were determined. Field performance was measured after 1 year. The effects of undercutting, rough-handling and exposure were highly species dependent. Undercutting tended to improve both moisture content and root electrolyte leakage but decrease the root/shoot (R/S) ratio. Rough-handling increased fine root leakage and decreased final height and diameter but had no significant effect on survival. Desiccation had a major effect on the electrolyte leakage from fine roots, increasing it, on average, three-fold over a 36-h exposure. Ash and oak survival was high irrespective of desiccation treatment, whereas survival of beech and especially of birch was impaired by drying. The effect of rough-handling was minor compared with desiccation but there was a detrimental interaction between dropping and 36-h desiccation on birch performance.

Two experiments were conducted in which seedlings were exposed to 0% and 50% natural defoliation by insect herbivores and placed in light gaps in simple notophyll vine forest at Paluma, near Townsville, North Queensland. In the first experiment, insect herbivory significantly increased mortality of 2-month-old seedlings. Smaller seedlings had significantly greater mortality rates than larger seedlings, irrespective of herbivory. A significantly greater proportion of smaller seedlings died from being smothered by fallen leaves and soil as a result of digging by vertebrates than for larger seedlings. In the second experiment, the effects of seedling age were examined by comparing 2-month and 4-month-old seedlings. Mortality rates were significantly influenced by seedling age, with eight rimes greater survival of older seedlings than of younger seedlings. Although insect herbivory was correlated with a significant decrease in shoot mass and a significant increase in root:shoot ratio, there was no effect of insect herbivory on seedling survival in the second experiment. Thus, mortality rates were greater for seedlings if they were young or small (which indirectly results from insect herbivory), because small, young seedlings were more susceptibile to other mortality factors, such as burial by fallen debris and digging by vertebrates.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Trop Rainforest Ecol & Managemen, Dept Zool & Trop Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA","Jackson, RV (reprint author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Trop Rainforest Ecol & Managemen, Dept Zool & Trop Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",,,,,,,30,10,11,0,0,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

The survey reveals that two dominant species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and Julbernardia seretii, form ectomycorrhizae and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, while Cynometra alexandri, another dominant, forms only vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae. These results, along with those of other species in this and other forests, are discussed within the context of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis for tropical mondominance.

Shade tolerant conifer species such as firs and spruces tend to have a lower specific leaf mass, photosynthetic rate at saturation, live crown ratio, STAR (shoot silhouette area to total needle surface area ratio), and root to shoot ratio than the shade intolerant pines. The inability of intolerant species such as the pines and aspen to survive in shade appears to be mainly the result of characteristics at the. shoot, crown, and whole-tree levels and not at the leaf level. Although firs and spruces frequently coexist in shaded understories, they do not have identical growth patterns and crown architectures. We propose a simple framework based on the maximum height that different tree species can sustain in shade, which may help managers determine the timing of partial or complete harvests. Consideration of these functional aspects of regeneration is important to the understanding of boreal forest dynamics and can be useful to forest managers seeking to develop or assess novel silvicultural systems.","Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, GREFI,Ctr Ville Branch, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Minist Ressources Nat, Direct Rech, Ste Foy, PQ G1P 3W8, Canada; Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie & Geomat, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; McGill Univ, Dept Biol, GREFI, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Messier, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Grp Rech Ecol Forestiere, GREFI,Ctr Ville Branch, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",messier.christian@uqam.ca; rene.doucet@mrn.gouv.qc.ca; jean-claude.ruel@sbf.ulaval.ca; d325110@er.uqa.m.ca; ckelly@sky.lakeheadu.ca; martin@bio1.lan.mcgill.ca,"Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019",,,,,149,248,258,3,76,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Pinus densiflora, Juniperus rigida, Ilex pedunculosa and Lyonia ovalifolia, growing mostly on the upper part of the slope with shallow soil depth had shallower roots. Quercus serrata and Quercus glauca, occurring mostly on the lower slope with deep soil showed deeper rooting. Styrax japonica, mainly restricted to the foot slope, had shallower roots in spite of growing on the deepest soil. These relations can be explained by the soil moisture profile under drought: at each position on the slope. On the upper part of the slope and the foot slope, deep rooting brings little advantage in water uptake from the soil due to the total drying of the soil and no period of drying even in the shallow soil, respectively. However, deep rooting is useful on the lower slope where only the deep soil layer keeps moist. This was supported by better diameter growth of a deep-rooting species on deeper soil sites than on shallower soil sites, although a shallow-rooting species showed little difference between them.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Yanagisawa, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",,,,,,,35,43,49,0,28,BLACKWELL SCIENCE ASIA,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0912-3814,,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

In a second experiment, C. maculosa grown with larger F. idahoensis were 66% larger, in the presence of AM fungi, than when AM fungi were absent. Centaurea maculosa biomass was not affected by AM fungi, in either phosphorus treatment, in the absence of F. idahoensis. Root:shoot ratios differed between phosphorus treatments, but this difference seemed to be a result of slower growth in the organic phosphorus treatment. Our results were unusual in that the direct effects of mycorrhizae on both species were weak, but the indirect effect of AM fungi on the interactions between C. maculosa and F. idahoensis was strong. Our results suggest that AM fungi strongly enhance the ability of C. maculosa to invade native grasslands of western North America.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Marler, MJ (reprint author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,,,,,,51,258,294,8,130,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1180,1186,,10.2307/177065,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Hartnett, DC; Wilson, GWT",,,,"Hartnett, DC; Wilson, GWT",,,Mycorrhizae influence plant community structure and diversity in tallgrass prairie,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; community structure; diversity; fungicide; grasslands; species richness; tallgrass prairie,PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION; FUNGI; GRASSES; COMPETITION; FIELD; INFECTION; SYMBIOSIS; BENOMYL; DEPENDENCE; RESPONSES,"In grassland ecosystems, symbiotic associations between plants and mycorrhizal fungi are widespread and have important influences on the life histories, demography, and species interactions of plants, and on belowground ecosystem processes. To assess the consequences of the symbiosis at the plant community level, we conducted a 5-yr field experiment in tallgrass prairie to investigate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant species composition, relative abundances, and diversity. Replicate plots in which mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed with benomyl application every two weeks during each growing season, were compared to nontreated mycorrhizal control plots on six watershed units at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas. Benomyl successfully reduced mycorrhizal colonization to <25% of mycorrhizal control plots. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots in control plots was inversely related to annual precipitation. Suppression of mycorrhizae resulted in decreases in abundances of the dominant, obligately mycotrophic C-4 tall grasses, compensatory increases in abundances of many subordinate facultatively mycotrophic C-3 grasses and forbs, but no change in total aboveground biomass, as estimated from canopy density. Suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis resulted in a large increase in plant species diversity. Two possible mechanisms for mycorrhizal mediation of plant species composition and diversity are: (1) alterations in resource distribution among neighbors via hyphal connections, and (2) differential host species responses to mycorrhizal fungal colonization in communities in which the competitive dominants are more strongly or more weakly mycotrophic than their neighbors. The results of this study demonstrate that mycorrhizal symbiosis can have large effects on plant community structure, and that differential host species response to fungal colonization is a key factor explaining the dominance of warm-season C-4 grasses in tallgrass prairie and limiting plant species evenness and diversity. The results also underscore the importance of above- and belowground linkages in tallgrass prairie and indicate that alterations in belowground fungi and rhizosphere processes can have large effects on aboveground floristic composition and diversity in grasslands.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Hartnett, DC (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",,"Wilson, Gail/G-4255-2012",,,,,52,305,358,8,201,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,1999,80,4,,,,,1187,1195,,10.2307/177066,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,215EG,WOS:000081368500010,,,,,10/31/19J,"Callaway, RM; DeLuca, TH; Belliveau, WM",,,,"Callaway, RM; DeLuca, TH; Belliveau, WM",,,Biological-control herbivores may increase competitive ability of the noxious weed Centaurea maculosa,ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agapeta zoegana Lin; biocontrols; Centaurea maculosa Lam.; competition; consumption; exotics; Festuca idahoensis Elmer; herbivory; indirect and higher order ineractions; invasive plants; knapweed; Trichoplusia ni Hubner,SESQUITERPENE LACTONE; DIFFUSE KNAPWEED; ROOT EXUDATION; NORTH-AMERICA; PHOSPHORUS; RESPONSES; GROWTH; OVERCOMPENSATION; AVAILABILITY; ASTERACEAE,"Biocontrol organisms are generally applied in an attempt to reduce the vigor of target species and provide native species with an competitive advantage. We tested the effectiveness of a widely used biocontrol moth, Agapeta zoegana (knapweed root moth) for two years in the field and found that it had no significant direct effect on the biomass of Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), one of the most destructive invasive plants in North America. Instead of releasing a native grass from competition, the reproductive output of Festuca idahoensis planted with Centaurea was significantly lower when neighboring Centaurea had been attacked by Agapeta. In a greenhouse experiment, we found that Festuca planted in pots with Centaurea that had been attacked by Trichoplusia ni (another nonnative herbivore) had significantly smaller root systems than when they were planted with Centaurea that were protected from herbivory. Root systems of Centaurea that had been attacked by Trichoplusia exuded higher levels of total sugars, but not total phenols. We hypothesize that moderate herbivory stimulated compensatory growth, induced the production of defense chemicals that also had allelopathic effects, or stimulated root exudates that altered the relationship between Ce,Centaurea and Festuca via soil microbes.

In order to test if any effects on the symbiosis can persist after long-term treatment, we examined root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and other fungi of several plant species from two grassland communities after continuous exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 for six growing seasons in the field. For plant species from both a sandstone and a serpentine annual grassland there was evidence for changes in fungal root colonization, with changes occurring as a function of giant host species. We documented decreases in percentage nonmycorrhizal fungal root colonization in elevated CO2 for several plant species. Total AM root colonization (%) only increased significantly for one out of the five plant species in each grassland. However, when dividing AM fungal hyphae into two groups of hyphae (fine endophyte and coarse endophyte), we could document significant responses of AM fungi that were hidden when only total percentage colonization was measured. We also documented changes in elevated CO2 in the percentage of root colonized by both AM hyphal types simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that changes in fungal root colonization can occur after long-term CO2 enrichment, and that the level of resolution of the study of AM fungal responses may have to be increased to uncover significant changes to the CO2 treatment. This study is also one of the first to document compositional changes in the AM fungi colonizing roots of plants grown in elevated CO2. Although it is difficult to relate the structural data directly to functional changes, possible implications of the observed changes for plant communities are discussed.","Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Plant Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Conservat Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Rillig, MC (reprint author), Carnegie Inst Washington, Dept Plant Biol, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",matthias@jasper.stanford.edu,"Rillig, Matthias C/B-3675-2009","Rillig, Matthias C/0000-0003-3541-7853",,,,38,29,31,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

The ability of rhizobial isolates to form effective symbiotic interactions showed marked host population and rhizobial-isolate effects in a study of eight, four and nine populations of A. dealbata, A. implexa and A. mearnsii. A more complete trial involved three populations of each of A. dealbata, A. implexa, A. irrorata, A. mearnsii and A. melanoxylon. These were inoculated with a range of rhizobial isolates previously shown to be highly, moderately or weakly successful in forming an effective association. Evidence of marked host population and rhizobial origin effects was found but there was very little evidence of isolate-host population interaction effects. 3. The general lack of host population-rhizobial origin interaction effects suggests that rhizobial strains selected as highly effective for an Acacia species growing in a particular population will generally perform well symbiotically with that species in other populations. This will make their practical application as inoculants in revegetation and forestry situations much easier. 4. Significant host-based variability in the ability to form effective symbiotic interactions was detected in comparisons of half-sib families of A. dealbata, A. mearnsii and A. melanoxylon. In the case of A. dealbata, the interaction between half-sib family lines and rhizobial isolates was complex, with 'locally' derived isolates performing better than 'foreign' ones. There were also significant interaction effects, In A. mearnsii, on the other hand, the only significant differences were detected between the response of different half-sib families to the same rhizobial isolate. The occurrence of host-based variability indicates that in Acacia breeding programmes attention should be given to the possibility of inadvertent selection affecting these relationships.","CSIRO Plant Ind, Ctr Plant Biodivers Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO Forestry & Forest Prod, Kingston, ACT 2604, Australia","Burdon, JJ (reprint author), CSIRO Plant Ind, Ctr Plant Biodivers Res, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Jeremy.Burdon@pi.csiro.au,"Burdon, Jeremy/B-9913-2009",,,,,19,89,92,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The grasslands showed contrasting root responses to CO2, enrichment: whereas root length was not affected in the sandstone grassland, it was greater in the serpentine grassland, as was specific root length. AM fungal hyphal lengths were greater in the sandstone, but were unaffected in the serpentine community. This lent support to the hypothesis that there may be a tradeoff in resource allocation to more fine roots or greater mycorrhizal extraradical hyphal length. AM root infection was greater in both communities at elevated CO2, as was the proportion of roots containing arbuscules. Our data on total hyphal lengths, culturable and active fungi, bacteria, and protozoa supported the hypothesis that the fungal food chain was more strongly stimulated than the bacterial chain.

We assessed the distribution of AM fungi in two similar depressional wetlands dominated by the semi-aquatic grass Panicum hemitomon by sampling soil in plots along dry-to-wet gradients that spanned 80 cm in relative elevation, and identifying/counting viable AM fungal spores. We found that eight of nine AM fungal species were common to both of the wetlands. Within each wetland, there were significant differences in species composition related to relative water depth. The zonation patterns were not identical between wetlands but revealed that certain species were relegated to the drier portions of the gradient in both. No species were relegated to only the wet portions of the wetlands; those that dominated there were also present in the drier areas. Our data show that water depth is an important factor determining the distribution of the AM fungi, even when, as in our study wetlands, the host plant remains constant along a dry-to-wet gradient. This suggests that the fungi are not physiologically equivalent in their tolerance to wetland conditions.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30605 USA; Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92696 USA","Miller, SP (reprint author), W Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, POB 6057, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",,,,,,,35,67,72,1,23,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1999,119,4,,,,,586,592,,10.1007/s004420050823,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,210WU,WOS:000081128300015,28307718,,,,10/31/19J,"Esler, KJ; Rundel, PW",,,,"Esler, KJ; Rundel, PW",,,Comparative patterns of phenology and growth form diversity in two winter rainfall deserts: the Succulent Karoo and Mojave Desert ecosystems,PLANT ECOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Workshop on the Plant Ecology of Namaqualand,"JUL 17-18, 1997","UNIV CAPE TOWN, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA",,UNIV CAPE TOWN,convergent evolution; desert annual; leaf succulent; Namaqualand; rooting depth,SOUTHERN AFRICA; CLIMATE; PLANTS,"A comparative study of community structure and seasonal growth dynamics in the arid winter rainfall regions of the Succulent Karoo in South Africa and the Mojave Desert of the United States suggests that remarkably divergent patterns of resource use and resultant growth form diversity exist in regions with outwardly similar climatic regimes. An understanding of these divergent patterns in the two winter rainfall deserts allows predictions to be made on vegetation response to global change. Above-ground plant growth in the Succulent Karoo begins with the first significant rains in late summer and continues through winter because moderate minimum temperatures allow continued growth. These communities have low structural diversity above-ground, but also below-ground, where root systems commonly do not exceed 20 cm in depth. These shallow root systems harvest water from upper soil horizons soon after rain falls, and growth declines as rainfall decreases in late spring. In contrast, low temperatures during winter inhibit growth in the Mojave Desert until early spring at a time when a mean 74% of the hydrologic year precipitation (July-June) has already occurred. Thus species in this structurally diverse system rely on deeper stores of water for growth in spring and early summer. A global change scenario of a 2 to 4 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature and increased summer rainfall in the Mojave desert would be expected to produce similar conditions in the Mojave Desert to those that exist in the Succulent Karoo today. Assuming no genetic constraints on phenotypic plasticity, this would suggest increased species diversity and a decline in structural diversity in the Mojave Desert over evolutionary time. Increased summer rainfall in the Succulent Karoo would be expected to lead to invasions of grasses and thus increased competitive pressure reducing community diversity.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Esler, KJ (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",,"Esler, Karen J/A-1640-2008","Esler, Karen J/0000-0001-6510-727X",,,,34,39,41,1,37,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,1999,142,2-Jan,,,,,97,104,,10.1023/A:1009830513525,,,8,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,235FX,WOS:000082531800008,,,,,10/31/19J,"Genkai-Kato, M; Yamamura, N",,,,"Genkai-Kato, M; Yamamura, N",,,Evolution of mutualistic symbiosis without vertical transmission,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,mutualistic symbiosis; vertical transmission; differential equation; free-living state; utilization of waste products,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COEVOLUTION; PARASITISM; PLANT; MODEL,"Mutualistic symbioses are considered to evolve from parasitic relationships. Vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent organism to its progeny, has been suggested as a key factor causing reduction of symbiont virulence and evolution of mutualism. On the other hand, there are several mutualistic associations without vertical transmission, such as those between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, legumes and rhizobia, and some corals and dinoflagellates. It is expected that all mutualisms evolve perfect vertical transmission if the relationship is really mutualistic, because hosts may fail to acquire symbionts if they do not transmit the symbionts by vertical transmission. We have developed a mathematical model to clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis without vertical transmission should evolve. The evolution may occur when and only when (i) vertical transmission involves some costs in the host, (ii) the symbiont suffers direct negative effects if it exploits the host too intensively, (iii) the host establishes the ability to make use of waste products from the symbiont, and (iv) the mechanism of vertical transmission is controlled by the host. We also clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis with vertical transmission evolves.

Respiration rates were immediately reversed after returning to the alternate [CO2] (i.e., [CO2](a) --> [CO2](s) --> [CO2](a), and vice versa) suggesting a direct effect of elevated [CO2] on apparent respiration. Soil-[CO2]-based respiration rates decreased with increasing [CO2] on a dry mass and tissue [N] basis.

Corresponding to these root injuries, deficiencies of the soil structure in upper soil layers were found. In this study, the hypothesis being tested is, that if deficiencies in soil structure cause an intense shift in the soil aeration, then the growth and vitality of fine roots in oak stands are injured. Two varying plots were observed at three different sites in Baden-Wuerttemberg: one with intact and one with disturbed soil structure respectively The soil structure was assessed with field methods. On these plots soil aeration, soil respiration and opening of the soil by fine roots were examined. It was shown, that high gas diffusivity in the upper soil layers caused high rates of soil respiration. According to this finding, all quantitative root parameters were significantly larger in the better aerated plots. The density of fine roots was larger in the better aerated plots. This was also true of the root length/weight ratio, which is an indicator for the effectiveness of the opening of soil space by roots in relation to the input of resources (assimilates). The practical forest management has considered the two naturally occuring oak species of Middle Europe, to be widely insensitive to restrictions in soil aeration. Therefore, oaks have been the standard solution for badly drained, wet soils as e.g. gleyic luvisols. This silvicultural strategy must be reconsidered, in light of the faces which were derived in our study.","Abt Bodenkunde & Waldernahrung, Forstl Versuchs & Forschungsanstalt Baden Wurttem, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Gaertig, T (reprint author), Abt Bodenkunde & Waldernahrung, Forstl Versuchs & Forschungsanstalt Baden Wurttem, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",,"Schack-Kirchner, Helmer/W-9090-2019","Schack-Kirchner, Helmer/0000-0001-6255-8577",,,,16,10,10,0,5,SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",Feb-52,,,ALLG FORST JAGDZTG,Allg.

The evolution of geographic mosaic patterns was analyzed for symbioses of legume plants and root-nodule bacteria (rhizobia), where plants are commonly polymorphic for genes affecting mutualism specificity. Typically, some alleles confer broad compatibility, and others restrict the set of bacterial genotypes accepted by plants as mutualist partners. Metapopulation simulation models with genetic assumptions matching the observed form of symbiotic specificity show that selection can generate a stable geographic mosaic if certain conditions are satisfied regarding competitive abilities, fitness benefits from mutualism, and migration rates. The structure of geographic variation in natural populations of the annual legume Amphicarpaea bracteata, together with patterns of variation in symbiotic fitness, is consistent with the interpretation that a mosaic pattern of differentiation may exist.

An empirical model (y = A q(v) e(BT)) was fitted to the soil CO2 efflux data and was used to calculate annual soil carbon efflux from soil temperature (T) and soil volumetric water content (q(v)). The annual soil carbon efflux were 0.66 kg(c) m(-2) year(-1) in the main plot and 0.42 kg, m-2 year(-1) in the trenched plots. The difference between these two estimations was corrected for the decomposition of roots that were killed following trenching.

Approximately 75% of all roots kept their orientation throughout the root-soil plate on both plots. Equations were developed to describe allometric relationships between basal area, DBH, sum of A(r), and root biomass. With increasing stem diameter, the root biomass was allocated predominantly to and evenly distributed within the surface root system, effectively increasing tree stability.

Barren lands are revegetated on a large scale by aerial broadcasting of commercial grass seed of Festuca rubra cv. Leik (red fescue) and subsequent regular fertilizer application for five years. Vegetation cover following aerial seeding of F. rubra was recorded in three reclaimed sites, which were two, ten and 25 years old, in an inland area in southern Iceland. As a comparison, vegetation cover was also recorded on barren land. Plant succession was inferred from these records. Vegetation cover was recorded using the point-intercept method. Spores of arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) were recorded from each site. Barren lands have characteristically low (< 5%) vegetation cover. The highest cover of F. rubra was found two years after revegetation was initiated. Non-dependent AMF forbs also colonized and increased their cover rapidly in the second year due to fertilizer application, but after a decade their cover declined. Ten years after the aerial seeding, F. rubra disappeared and the area was dominated by the native grass Agrostis stolonifera (creeping bent grass). A cover of mosses and plant litter was also recorded on the ten-year-old site. AMF spores were low in all studied sites, and colonization of AMF was only found in the roots of A. stolonifera. After 25 years, it appeared that the cover of native forbs started to increase again and salix bushes were established. Aerial seeding of F. rubra failed to create a long-lasting cover to facilitate natural rapid succession. Alternative revegetation practices, taking into consideration the dynamics of the mutualistic microorganisms (Rhizobium and AMF)/plant association, are suggested for a better and more economic management of reclamation strategies.

In this study, custom-made microelectrodes were used to measure pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP or redox potential) distributions in vegetated and unvegetated munitions-contaminated soils. While pH was essentially uniform in unvegetated soil, in the vegetated soil the pH was lower near the root tips than at other locations around the root. The pH varied little in the radial (horizontal) direction but was highest (pH = 6.20) near the surface (0.5 cm depth) and lowest (pH = 4.99) at 6 cm below the soil surface. There was a strong correlation between the redox potential and pH. Therefore, redox potentials were normalized to pH 7 based on an experimentally obtained ORP-pH curve. In the vegetated soil, the redox potentials increased as the center of the plant was approached. The highest (ORP7 = 256 mV) and lowest (ORP7 = 191 mV) redox potentials were measured at 0.5 and 3 cm below the surface of the soil, respectively. In the unvegetated soil, redox potential decreased with depth, which can be attributed to reduced transport of oxygen from the air to soil.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Civil Engn, Omaha, NE 68182 USA","Zhang, TC (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Civil Engn, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",,,,,,,46,24,25,2,28,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

This model represents a realization of the concept of a 'single plant ecosystem' (Chertov, 1983a). EFIMOD simulates the biological cycle of every tree with an expedient soil pot in a stand. The tree models calculate the total leaf, fine root and litter mass using a set of the characteristic ecological tree parameters. The soil sub-model simultaneously allows for a calculation of the rate of tree litter and soil organic matter mineralization with the corresponding carbon dioxide and nitrogen release for plant growth. The validation of the model, with various initial stand densities on different soils, shows a relatively realistic picture of tree growth, stand self-thinning and soil changes. Convergence of leaf/needle mass has been observed at various initial stand densities. An application of EFIMOD for a qualitative evaluation of climate change effects shows fairly different reactions of the mentioned ecosystems in relation to productivity, leaf mass and soil organic matter pool. There is a shift in the timing of the first intensive self-thinning in young stands. A strong oscillation of leaf/needle mass has also been observed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We used delta(13)C for the estimation of water-use efficiency and delta(15)N and nitrogen concentration to determine the sources of nitrogen utilized. We correlated these variables with root allocation. 3. Seedling survival of the different species was positively correlated with root allocation and seed size. Root allocation was also positively correlated with seed size. delta(15)N and nitrogen concentration were also positively correlated with root allocation, but delta(13)C was not. 4.

Seasonal regulation of transpiration was studied in four evergreen woody species growing in a Brazilian cerrado (savanna) site with a 5 month dry season. 2. Both seasonal and interspecifc variation in leaf water potential (Psi(L)) were relatively small. Predawn Psi(L) was about 0.1-0.25 MPa more negative in the dry season than in the wet season. 3. The dependence of maximum whole-plant sap flow rates on sapwood area was similar among all four species during both the wet and dry seasons. When total daily sap flow on a leaf area basis was normalized by the daily average air saturation deficit (ASD), only one of the four species showed significantly greater water use during the wet season. 4. Although seasonal differences in regulation of transpiration were not pronounced. strong stomatal limitation of both maximum daily transpiration rates and total daily transpiration was evident during both the wet and dry seasons. Sap flow typically increased sharply in the morning, briefly attained a maximum value by about 09.30-10.30 h, then decreased sharply, despite steadily increasing solar radiation and atmospheric evaporative demand. 5. The total leaf area-specific apparent hydraulic conductance of the soil/leaf pathway (G(t)) varied among plants and diurnally, The identical linear dependence of transpiration and stomatal conductance (g(s)) on G(t) among the four study species suggested that stomatal adjustment to variation in G(t) limited transpiration over the entire range of G(t) observed. 6. When g(s) was normalized for daily variation in G(t), about 80% of the remaining variation in g(s) was associated with variation in ASD. The results: suggested that transpiration in these species was not limited by soil water availability per se, but by high atmospheric evaporative demand and hydraulic constraints possibly arising from their deep rooting habit.","Hawaii Agr Res Ctr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA; Univ Hawaii, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96701 USA; Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Brasilia, Dept Ecol, BR-70919970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Buenos Aires, Dept Biol, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Meinzer, FC (reprint author), Hawaii Agr Res Ctr, 99-193 Aiea Heights Dr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA.",,"Franco, Augusto/B-1615-2008; Bustamante, Mercedes/H-7597-2015; Meinzer, Frederick/C-3496-2012; Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019","Franco, Augusto/0000-0003-0869-5989; Bustamante, Mercedes/0000-0003-1008-452X; Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031",,,,26,140,161,0,30,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Around 150 species have been described and it is becoming clear that many of these species have different functional properties. The species diversity of AM fungi actively growing in roots is therefore an important component of ecosystem diversity. However, it is difficult to identify AM fungi below the genus level from morphology in planta, as they possess few informative characters. We present here a molecular method for identifying infrageneric sequence types that estimate the taxonomic diversity of AM fungi present in actively growing roots. Bluebell roots were sampled from beneath two different canopy types, oak and sycamore, and DNA sequences were amplified from roots by the polymerase chain reaction with fungal-specific primers for part of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism among 141 clones was assessed and 62 clones were sequenced. When aligned, discrete sequence groups emerged that cluster into the three families of AM fungi: Acaulosporaceae, Gigasporaceae and Glomaceae. The sequence variation is consistent with rRNA secondary structure. The same sequence types were found at both sampling times. Frequencies of Scutellospora increased in December, and Acaulospora increased in abundance in July. Sites with a sycamore canopy show a reduced abundance of Acaulospora, and those with oak showed a reduced abundance of Glomus. These distribution patterns are consistent with previous morphological studies carried out in this woodland. The molecular method provides an alternative method of estimating the distribution and abundance of AM fungi, and has the potential to provide greater resolution at the infrageneric level.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Helgason, T (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Young, Peter/C-1446-2012; Helgason, Thorunn/P-6435-2019","Young, Peter/0000-0001-5259-4830; Helgason, Thorunn/0000-0003-3639-1499",,,,28,157,172,0,49,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0962-1083,,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Upon abandonment, ponds often drain and the subsequent meadows persist for decades as graminoid patches that resist invasion of conifers despite their close proximity to seed sources. The lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soils of beaver meadows may limit the rate of conifer invasion. Small mammals such as the red backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) disperse spores of mycorrhizal fungi in their feces, and so the dispersal of spores by small mammals may be the rate-limiting step to conifer invasion of beaver meadows. We investigated the distribution and abundance of small mammals in beaver meadows and adjacent forests in northern Minnesota, USA during May and August, the abundance and species composition of fungal spores in their fecal pallets, and the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) seedlings in beaver meadow soils inoculated with these spores. C. gapperi was present in the forest and at the forest edge but was absent from beaver meadows. Abundance of C. gapperi was almost three times higher in August than in May. Feces from C. gapperi in May and August contained fungal spores from a total of nine genera of Fungi, and all but one are known to form ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Feces from August contained more fungal genera and more spores than Feces from May. Seedlings grown in uninoculated beaver meadow soils did not form ectomycorrhizae during the length of this study, but beaver meadow soils which received feces formed ectomycorrhizae on 20%, and 33%, of plants using May and August feces, respectively. In contrast, seedlings grown in soils from forests adjacent to beaver meadows Formed ectomycorrhizae on 100% of plants. Black spruce seedlings grown in beaver meadow soils containing August feces had significantly higher shoot, root, and total dry weights after 46 weeks of growth compared to uninoculated controls but plants grown in soils containing May feces were not significantly different from controls. In addition, seedlings grown in forest soils had significantly larger shoot, root, and total weights than plants grown in untreated beaver meadow soils at ail sampling periods. Flooding of forest soils for eight weeks had no significant effect on seedling growth parameters or mycorrhizal development. Lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi is likely a factor that limits conifer invasion into beaver meadows. C. gapperi is a potential vector for ectomycorrhizal fungal spores into beaver meadows, but the expression of this potential is limited by habitat use patterns of this small mammal.","Vermilion Community Coll, Ely, MN 55731 USA; Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA","Terwilliger, J (reprint author), Vermilion Community Coll, Ely, MN 55731 USA.",,"Pastor, John/F-6241-2011",,,,,86,92,98,0,54,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,1999,85,1,,,,,83,94,,10.2307/3546794,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192TD,WOS:000080094300009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Luan, JS; Luo, YQ; Reynolds, JF",,,,"Luan, JS; Luo, YQ; Reynolds, JF",,,Responses of a loblolly pine ecosystem to CO2 enrichment: a modeling analysis,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Workshop on Critical Assessment of the Response of Forest Ecosystems to Elevated Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide,"OCT 10-13, 1997","DURHAM, NC",,,carbon dioxide increase; FACE; global change; mineralization; nitrogen; Pinus taeda; root turnover,ELEVATED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; TAEDA L; GROWTH; FOREST; NITROGEN; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SEEDLINGS; TREES,"The development of the Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facilities represents a substantial advance in experimental technology for studying ecosystem responses to elevated CO2. A challenge arising from the application of this technology is the utilization of short-term FACE results for predicting long-term ecosystem responses. This modeling study was designed to explore interactions of various processes on ecosystem productivity at elevated CO2 on the decadal scale. We used a forest model (FORDYN) to analyze CO2 responses-particularly soil nitrogen dynamics, carbon production and storage-of a loblolly pine ecosystem in the Duke University Forest. When a 14-year-old stand was exposed to elevated CO2, simulated increases in annual net primary productivity (NPP) were 13, 10 and 7.5% in Years 1, 2 and 10, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. Carbon storage increased by 4% in trees and 9.2% in soil in Year 10 in response to elevated CO2. When the ecosystem was exposed to elevated CO2 from the beginning of forest regrowth, annual NPP and carbon storage in trees and soil were increased by 32, 18 and 20%, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. In addition, simulation of a 20% increase in mineralization rate led to a slight increase in biomass growth and carbon storage, but the simulated 20% increase in fine root turnover rate considerably increased annual NPP and carbon storage in soil. The modeling results indicated that (1) stimulation of NPP and carbon storage by elevated CO2, is transient and (2) effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem processes-canopy development, soil nitrogen mineralization and root turnover-have great impacts on ecosystem C dynamics. A detailed understanding of these processes will improve our ability to predict long-term ecosystem responses to CO2 enrichment.","Duke Univ, Dept Bot, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Desert Res Inst, Ctr Biol Sci, Reno, NV 89512 USA","Luo, YQ (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Bot & Microbiol, George Lynn Cross Hall,770 Van Vleet Oval, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",,"Reynolds, James/G-6364-2010",,,,,44,9,10,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,APR,1999,19,5-Apr,,,,,279,287,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,181NB,WOS:000079446400010,12651571,,,,10/31/19J,"Frioni, L; Minasian, H; Volfovicz, R",,,,"Frioni, L; Minasian, H; Volfovicz, R",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae in native tree legumes in Uruguay,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; ectomycorrhizae; leguminous trees; Uruguay,FUNGI; INFECTION; ROOTS,"The level of colonization by ectomycorrhizae (ECM) and arbuscular endomycorrhizae (AM) Of 23 species of native trees and shrub legumes was studied. Root samples were obtained from different regions of Uruguay. Colonization level was determined by observing AM fungal structures (hyphae, arbuscules, vesicules) in stained root segments. The number and morphological type of spores were determined in 100 g of rhizosphere soil. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was evaluated by direct and microscopic observation of root tips. All species had a high level of AM colonization. In Papilionoideae colonization varied between 62% and 78%, in the Mimosoideae between 18% and 69% and in the Caesalpinioideae the variation was larger (6-74%). These results show a significant presence of fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizae in our soils. The number of spores forming AM in rhizosphere soil (280-1.620 spores/100 g of dry soil) was also highly relative to references for other leguminous trees. Spores were grouped in three principal morphological types Acaulospora, Glomus and Sclerocystis. Presence of ECM fungi was evident only when observed under the microscope. 26% of the plant species exhibited this type of mycorrhizae, reaching a maximal value of 36% in Mimosoideae. Only six plant species exhibited both types of mycorrhizae. Dual colonization could help in the colonization of poor soils and for their use in agroforestry systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the review viewpoints are discussed on the soil-quality concept, suggested frameworks for its assessment, and possible methods for the selection and evaluation of quality indicators. These sections are in general terms, without emphasis on chemical, physical or biological soil properties. The potential value of including microbiological indicators in a monitoring system is discussed thoroughly. Several possible microbiological indicators are suggested, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Strategies for the selection and sampling of monitoring sites are reviewed, and the treatment of samples before analyses is also discussed. In conclusion, a framework for using microbiological indicators in a Swedish monitoring system is suggested.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Stenberg, B (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Microbiol, Box 7025, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,132,88,121,3,57,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",0906-4710,,,ACTA AGR SCAND B-S P,Acta Agric.

The storm was reconstituted at different scales by using the MC2 model developed by Environment Canada and results were overlayed with windthrow mapping and forest-ecological maps. Logistic regression was used for the main combinations of variables to test the effect of wind speed, surface deposit, stand type and age. No effect of wind speed could be demonstrated. However, the damage level increased with increasing stand proportion of balsam fir in Charlevoix and with age of balsam fir stands in both regions. Damage also increased when surface deposits restricted rooting depth in the Gaspe peninsula. Much of the damage in both regions appears to be linked with an abundance of mature and overmature stands.","Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Ruel, JC (reprint author), Univ Laval, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,,,,,39,15,16,0,2,CANADIAN INST FORESTRY,OTTAWA,"151 SLATER ST, STE 606, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1P 5H3, CANADA",0015-7546,,,FOREST CHRON,For.

Survival of these populations in the presence of competitive alien plants suggested 2 possibilities: 1) that Idaho fescue produces seedlings that successfully compete for soil resources with alien invaders, and 2) that Idaho fescue seedlings tolerate stress caused by resource uptake by alien neighbors. We compared germination and growth of Idaho fescue from an undisturbed population with that of conspecific populations from disturbed (grazed and invaded) sites to determine whether disturbed-site seedlings had greater potential for resource capture. Recruitment in Idaho fescue from degraded sites did not appear to be aided by rapid seed germination or greater tolerance of moisture stress during germination. A greater proportion of seeds from the undisturbed site germinated; they germinated faster, and were no more sensitive to water stress, than were seeds from disturbed sites. For both groups, decreasing water potential from 0 to -0.5 MPa had little effect on germination percentages but declined at -1 Mpa. Germination rates slowed with decreasing water potential. Though Idaho fescue from undisturbed and disturbed sites extended roots down the soil profile with equal speed, seedlings from the undisturbed site produced 3.5 times more root length, had 2.7 times greater root length density, and 3.4 times more leaf area than disturbed-site Idaho fescue. The higher growth rate and greater root length density in Idaho fescue from the undisturbed site translates to greater exploration and exploitation of the environment. The 2 Idaho fescue groups had equivalent specific root length, specific leaf area, and root weight ratio. Idaho fescue from disturbed sites showed strong, positive geotropic growth whereas branching and diageotropic growth were greater in Idaho fescue from the undisturbed site. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) extended roots faster than did Idaho fescue, with 17 times the root length, 6 times the root length density, and 10.8 times the leaf area of undisturbed-site Idaho fescue. Cheatgrass and Idaho fescue had equivalent specific leaf area, but specific root length of Idaho fescue was nearly twice that of the alien. Roots accounted for about 31% and 55% of cheatgrass biomass. Competitive ability did not appear to promote recruitment in Idaho fescue populations on degraded rangelands. Idaho fescue seedlings from the undisturbed-site were better competitors than disturbed-site seedlings, but interference from neighboring cheatgrass most strongly inhibited shoot growth of both Idaho fescue and cheatgrass. Idaho fescue had little effect on cheatgrass shoot growth. Selection of stress-tolerant genotypes from original populations may best explain the continued existence of Idaho fescue on grazed and invaded sites. We suggest that tolerance of moisture stress combined with vegetative longevity, are mechanisms behind Idaho fescue's persistence.","Bureau Land Management, Hines, OR 97738 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Oregon State Univ, Dept Rangeland Resources, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Goodwin, JR (reprint author), Bureau Land Management, HC 74-12533 Hwy 20 W, Hines, OR 97738 USA.",,,,,,,57,4,6,4,25,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,DENVER,"1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

To date, geographic studies have failed to incorporate treatment groups that included naturally browsed plants along with clipping treatments. The results presented here clearly demonstrate the importance of assessing, a priori, whether or not clipping experiments accurately reflect natural patterns of herbivory. Although because of the timing of the clip no evidence of overcompensation was found in any of the Colorado populations when ungulate herbivory was simulated in experimental clipping treatments, evidence for overcompensation was found in more than half the populations when plants that were naturally browsed and matched for size using root diameters were included early in the season. Matching plants for size based on root diameter late in the season would be problematic because root diameters significantly increased in size in all eight populations following high levels of ungulate herbivory and/or experimental clipping. Results from this study, and other recent studies on another biennial herb. the field gentian. clearly demonstrate that overcompensation is not only a real phenomenon but also is more widespread, both taxonomically and geographically, than previously thought.","Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Paige, KN (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Ecol Ethol & Evolut, 505 S Goodwin Ave,515 Morrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,14,95,101,4,27,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1999,118,3,,,,,316,323,,10.1007/s004420050732,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,180NK,WOS:000079391900005,28307275,,,,10/31/19J,"Hobbie, EA; Macko, SA; Shugart, HH",,,,"Hobbie, EA; Macko, SA; Shugart, HH",,,Insights into nitrogen and carbon dynamics of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi from isotopic evidence,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,nitrogen dynamics; nitrogen isotope ratio; carbon isotope ratio; mycorrhizal fungi; succession,N-15 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; GLACIER BAY; CONIFEROUS SEEDLINGS; PRIMARY SUCCESSION; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL-NITROGEN; SOLUTION PH; OLD-FIELD; ALASKA; COMPARTMENTS,"The successful use of natural abundances of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes in the study of ecosystem dynamics suggests that isotopic measurements could yield new insights into the role of fungi in nitrogen and carbon cycling. Sporocarps of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi, vegetation, and soils were collected in young, deciduous-dominated sites and older, coniferous-dominated sites along a successional sequence at Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. Mycorrhizal fungi had consistently higher delta(15)N and lower delta(13)C values than saprotrophic fungi. Foliar delta(13)C values were always isotopically depleted relative to both fungal types. Foliar delta(15)N values were usually, but not always, more depleted than those in saprotrophic fungi, and were consistently more depleted than in mycorrhizal fungi. We hypothesize that an apparent isotopic fractionation by mycorrhizal fungi during the transfer of nitrogen to plants may be attributed to enzymatic reactions within the fungi producing isotopically depleted amino acids, which are subsequently passed on to plant symbionts. An increasing difference between soil mineral nitrogen delta(15)N and foliar delta(15)N in later succession might therefore be a consequence of greater reliance on mycorrhizal symbionts for nitrogen supply under nitrogen-limited conditions. Carbon signatures of mycorrhizal fungi may be more enriched than those of foliage because the fungi use isotopically enriched photosynthate such as simple sugars, in contrast to the mixture of compounds present in leaves. In addition, some C-13 fractionation may occur during transport processes from leaves to roots, and during fungal chitin biosynthesis. Stable isotopes have the potential to help clarify the role of fungi in ecosystem processes.","Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Hobbie, EA (reprint author), US EPA, 200 SW 35Th St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",hobbie@mail.cor.epa.gov,"Shugart, Herman/C-5156-2009","Shugart, Herman/0000-0002-1766-8379",,,,45,196,203,4,99,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1999,118,3,,,,,353,360,,10.1007/s004420050736,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,180NK,WOS:000079391900009,28307279,,,,10/31/19J,"Boddington, CL; Bassett, EE; Jakobsen, I; Dodd, JC",,,,"Boddington, CL; Bassett, EE; Jakobsen, I; Dodd, JC",,,Comparison of techniques for the extraction and quantification of extra-radical mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in soils,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MEMBRANE-FILTER TECHNIQUE; EXTERNAL HYPHAE; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; LENGTH; ROOT,,"Univ Kent, Int Inst Biotechnol, Dept Biosci, Biotechnol MIRCEN, Canterbury CT2 7YW, Kent, England; Univ Kent, Inst Math & Stat, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England; Riso Natl Lab, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Dodd, JC (reprint author), Univ Kent, Int Inst Biotechnol, Dept Biosci, Biotechnol MIRCEN, Canterbury CT2 7YW, Kent, England.",,"Jakobsen, Iver/F-1116-2011; Jakobsen, Iver/C-2924-2015","Jakobsen, Iver/0000-0002-4548-8535",,,,13,26,31,1,15,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Plots (30 x 30 m) were located at the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in central Massachusetts. Two forms of N-15 tracer were applied, with (NH4)-N-15 and (NO3)-N-15 added to separate halves of reference and chronically fertilized plots in each forest. Tracers were applied monthly during two growing seasons in order to simulate movements of background (8 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and chronically elevated (58 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) N deposition. Forest floors and soils were the dominant sinks for N deposition in these forests, but the relative importance of trees as sinks for N inputs increased with N loading rate. Accumulations of N-15 in tree tissues after 2 yr of tracer additions showed that tree leaves, fine roots, bark, and recently formed wood assimilated <5% of the N-15 added to reference plots and 20-24% of the N-15 added to fertilized plots. The form of N input influenced its movement into ecosystem pools. Percent recoveries of N-15 in trees were typically greater after (NO3)-N-15 additions than after (NH4)-N-15 additions. Woody tissues (wood less than or equal to 5 yr old plus bark) accumulated small fractions of N inputs after 2 yr of tracer additions, with N-15 recoveries of <1% under ambient N deposition and <5% under chronic N fertilization. Regional and global assessments of the effects of N deposition on forest carbon balances should take into account observations suggesting that, although the proportion of N deposition assimilated by trees could increase with N input rate, most N deposition retained by temperate forests is likely to accumulate in soil pools with low C:N rather than in woody biomass with high C:N ratios.","Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, FL 33199 USA","Nadelhoffer, KJ (reprint author), Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",knute@lupine.mbl.edu,"Downs, Martha/C-3809-2011","Downs, Martha/0000-0003-2833-956X",,,,53,142,157,4,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In this study, we applied a dual stable isotope approach to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and elevated temperature on these components of soil CO2 efflux in Douglas-fir terracosms. We measured both soil CO2 efflux rates and the C-13 and O-18 isotopic compositions of soil CO2 efflux in 12 sun-lit and environmentally controlled terracosms with 4-year-old Douglas fir seedlings and reconstructed forest soils under two CO2 concentrations (ambient and 200 ppmv above ambient) and two air temperature regimes (ambient and 4 degrees C above ambient). The stable isotope data were used to estimate the relative contributions of different components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. In most cases, litter decomposition was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in this system, followed by rhizosphere respiration and soil organic matter oxidation. Both elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated temperature stimulated rhizosphere respiration and litter decomposition. The oxidation of soil organic matter was stimulated only by increasing temperature. Release of newly fixed carbon as root respiration was the most responsive to elevated CO2, while soil organic matter decomposition was most responsive to increasing temperature. Although some assumptions associated with this new method need to be further validated, application of this dual-isotope approach can provide new insights into the responses of soil carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems to future climate changes.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Stable Isotope Ratio Facil Environm Res, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; US EPA, Natl Hlth & Environm Effects Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA","Lin, GH (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Biosphere Ctr 2, POB 689, Oracle, AZ 85623 USA.",,"Lin, Guanghui/I-6850-2013; Lin, GH/G-4593-2010; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010","Lin, Guanghui/0000-0001-6108-3215; ",,,,42,117,155,11,84,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-1013,,,GLOB CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We used a pulse EKKO 1000 GPR system, a profile grid of 0.25 x 0.25 meters, at 0.05 m intervals, and a signal frequency of 450 MHz, to assure resolution of about 3 cm in both directions (further increases in resolution up to 1 cm are possible with the system). Coarse root density was 6.5 m m(-2) of stand area and 3.3 m m(-3) of soil volume. Maximum rooting depth of the experimental oaks was 2 m, and the root ground plan was significantly larger (about 1.5 times) than the crown ground plan. Based on earlier studies of Quercus robur L. from floodplain forests, where the extent of the root systems was much smaller (root ground plan:crown ground plan ratio of 0.6), we conclude that the high root ground plan:crown ground plan ratio indicates less favorable conditions of water supply at the experimental site than in the floodplain forest.

The root : shoot ratio of unattached S. album increased exponentially over the 38 week period. Seedling growth declined for all treatments between the 33 and 38 week harvests, except for those seedlings attached to A. trachycarpa. A strong positive linear relationship was shown between S. album leaf area and shoot DW irrespective of host species. No relationship was found between S. album shoot DW and root: shoot ratio with host shoot DW. The combined E. camaldulensis and S. album root system supported a smaller S. album shoot biomass compared with the S, album shoot biomass supported by the combined root systems of the N-2-fixing hosts and S, album. Compared with all other host species the A. trachycarpa root system was more efficient in supporting its own shoot biomass and the total biomass of S. album. Host use efficiency (S. album shoot DW/host shoot DW) values of S. formosa and A. trachycarpa were greater than the host use efficiency values of A. ampliceps and E. camaldulensis.

C and N decrease in seeds was unaltered by CO2. At the end of seed contribution (day 35), C and N accumulation in seedlings was favoured under 800 mu L L-1 [CO2], resulting in an increase of about +50 % for C and +35 % for N. Growth enhancement was larger in roots than in shoot, resulting in a higher root:shoot ratio (R:S = 0.62) with respect to 550 mu L L-1 CO, (R:S = 0.40) at day 55. These results were due, in order, to: 1) a shoot respiration temporarily depressed by [CO2], 2) a reduction by 46 % of the root + soil respiration, 3) a stimulation by 14 % of the C assimilation and 1) an increased uptake and assimilation of N coming from the rooting medium. An increased use of N originated from the seed was observed in leaves and lateral roots, suggesting optimisation of distribution of stored N pools by seedlings. These changes finally gave rise to an increased C:N ratio for taproot (+27 %), roots (+20 %), stem (+28 %), and leaves (+12 %), suggesting a N dilution in the tissues.

Results for soft-agar, capillary tube and soil chemotaxis assays indicated that selected deleterious rhizobacteria were attracted to seed and seedling root exudates. Several sugars and phenolic fractions detected in exudates were chemoattractants for these rhizobacteria. Using soil-chemotaxis assemblies, migration of rhizobacterial isolates through 2 cm distances of soil toward birdsfoot trefoil seeds was detected within 24 h. Isolates were not detected at the same site in soils without seeds until 72 h after inoculation. These results suggest that attraction of deleterious rhizobacteria toward seeds and seedling roots mediated by exudates (chemotaxis) might be the first step in the establishment and subsequent colonization of bacteria involved in soilborne disease complexes of birdsfoot trefoil.

At 100 mol m(-3) KCl, cultivar Lee lost its capacity to exclude Cl- from the leaves and its growth was poor.

We examined effects of 60% and 100% defoliation (excluding current year needles) on tree growth and ectomycorrhizal associations of 10-15 year old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). Over 98% of short roots were colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, and contrary to expectation, defoliation did not decrease the proportion of living fungi in fine roots. Furthermore, defoliation did not alter the ratios of produced needle biomass to the biomass of fine roots or living fungi in fine roots. The composition of mycorrhizal morphotypes was changed, however, which suggests competition among different mycorrhizal growth forms owing to their carbon demands. We propose that these outcomes are a consequence of a functional balance between carbon sources in plant foliage and below-ground sinks, i.e, growing roots and mycorrhizal associates.","Turku Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Turku Univ, Kevo Subarctic Res Inst, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Oulu Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland","Saikkonen, K (reprint author), Turku Univ, Dept Biol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",karisaik@utu.fi,,"Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",,,,48,63,66,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

III this study it is demonstrated that the dynamics within mutualism can contribute: to the maintenance of diversity within its participants, using a general model of frequency dependence between two mutualistically interacting guilds. Specifically, it is demonstrated that while mutualisms may exhibit positive feedback in density, there may be a negative feedback within a mutualism as a result of the change in composition within the interacting guild. Such a negative feedback results from an asymmetry in the delivery of benefit between participants of the mutualism that generates a negative interguild frequency dependence. This dynamic contributes to the maintenance of diversity within the interacting guilds. Conditions are identified for the maintenance of diversity and the maximization of benefit from mutualism within the concert of the model. The utility of these conditions for testing hypotheses using data from the mutualistic interaction between plants and mycorrhizal fungi is then demonstrated.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Bever, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,,,,,,51,110,113,0,43,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Aerosols were collected with wet and dry sampling devices. Evaluation for the presence of total bio-mass from bacterial and non-bacterial sources of ATP was achieved by suspending the collected aerosol samples in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pipeting a 50-mu l aliquot of the PBS suspension into a Filtravette(TM), and then adding bacterial releasing agent (BRA). The sample was then reacted with L-L, and the resulting Relative Luminescence Units (RLU's), indicative of ATP from all sources, were measured. Bacterial cells were enumerated with the additional application of a wash with somatic cell releasing agent (SRA) to remove any interferences and non-bacterial sources of ATP prior to BRA application. This step removes interfering substances and non-bacterial sources of ATP. For spore analysis, an equi-volume sample of the PBS suspension was added to an equivolume of trypticase soy broth (TSB), incubated at 37 C for 15 minutes, and processed using methods identical to bacterial cell analysis. Using these techniques we were able to detect Bacillus subtilis variation niger, formerly known as Bacillus globigii (BG), in aerosol samples at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU) per ml. Results of field and chamber trials show that one can detect the presence of bacterial and non-bacterial sources of ATP. One can also differentiate spore and vegetative bacterial cells. These techniques may be appropriate to situations where the measurement of bacterial aerosols is needed.","USA, Edgewood Chem Biol Ctr, Res & Technol Directorate, AMSSB RRT DD, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA","Stopa, PJ (reprint author), USA, Edgewood Chem Biol Ctr, Res & Technol Directorate, AMSSB RRT DD, 5183 Blackhawk Rd,E3160, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010 USA.",,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3446-9,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999,3853,,,,,,143,149,,10.1117/12.372848,,,7,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics,BP39N,WOS:000084986200017,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fokin, AD",,,,"Fokin, AD",,,The role of plants in redistribution of substances along the soil profile,EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The role of plants in redistribution of substances along the vertical soil profile is shown.

This model simulates carbon (C) and water fluxes from individual or multiple forest patches, sequentially (area weighted), that may vary in structure and species composition. In this contribution, simulations of C fluxes for 1997 are presented for a hypothetical forest comprised of three patches: a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand without understory (assumed 50% of the forest), a Molinia caerulea L. grassland (25% of the forest), and a Scots pine stand with a Molinia understory (also 25% of the forest ecosystem). Simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) and net canopy assimilation (NETp) for this forest ecosystem were 19.7 and 5.9 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1), respectively. Net canopy assimilation is defined here as GPP minus maintenance respiration and minus fine root exudates. Autotrophic respiration was nearly 70% of GPP. Simulated total ecosystem respiration was 13.2 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1) and, therefore, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for 1997 for base simulations was close to 3.0 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1). However, the interval of uncertainty (IOU) in NEE - based on analyses of the random error in canopy architecture, leaf area index, and/or basic gas exchange characteristics - ranged from 2.2 to 3.9 Mg C ha(-1) a(-1). As such, it was concluded from the model simulations that this three-patches forest ecosystem was a slight sink for carbon during the 1997 simulation year. Eddy flux measurements made during the same period above the entire forest, comprised of many different forest patches, confirmed these simulated values.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","Ceulemans, R (reprint author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.",,"Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358",,,,33,9,9,0,3,S P B ACADEMIC PUBL BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 11188, 1001 GD AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,90-5103-138-6,,,,1999,,,,,,,95,108,,,,,14,Ecology; Forestry; Remote Sensing,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry; Remote Sensing,BQ52Z,WOS:000088667300006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Thomas, SM; Whitehead, D; Reid, JB; Cook, FJ; Adams, JA; Leckie, AC",,,,"Thomas, SM; Whitehead, D; Reid, JB; Cook, FJ; Adams, JA; Leckie, AC",,,"Growth, loss, and vertical distribution of Pinus radiata fine roots growing at ambient and elevated CO2 concentration",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,elevated CO2 concentration; fine root growth; fine root loss; minirhizotron; Pinus radiata; root distribution,KIWIFRUIT ACTINIDIA-DELICIOSA; CARBON-DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; PONDEROSA PINE; BELOWGROUND RESPONSES; BETULA-PAPYRIFERA; N-AVAILABILITY; COTTON ROOT; FORESTS; NITROGEN,"Increased below-ground carbon allocation in forest ecosystems is a likely consequence of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. If this results in changes to fine root growth, turnover and distribution long-term soil carbon cycling and storage could be altered. Bi-weekly measurements were made to determine the dynamics and distribution of fine roots (<1 mm diameter) for Pinus radiata trees growing at ambient (350 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (650 mu mol mol(-1)) CO2 concentration in large open-top chambers. Measurements were made using minirhizotrons installed horizontally at depths of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 m. During the first year, at a depth of 0.3 m, the increase in relative growth rate of roots occurred 6 weeks earlier in the elevated CO2 treatment and the maximum rate was reached 10 weeks earlier than for trees in the ambient treatment. After 2 years, cumulative fine root growth (P-t) was 36% greater for trees growing at elevated CO2 than at ambient CO2 concentration, although this difference was not significant. A model of root growth driven by daily soil temperature accounted for between 43 and 99% of root growth variability. Total root loss (L-t) was 9% in the ambient and 14% in the elevated CO2 treatment, although this difference was not significant. Root loss was greatest at 0.3 m. In the first year, 62% of fine roots grown between mid-summer and late-autumn disappeared within a year in the elevated CO2 treatment, but only 18% in the ambient CO2 treatment (P < 0.01). An exponential model relating L-t to time accounted for between 74 and 99% of the variability. Root cohort half-lives were 951 d for the ambient and 333 d for the elevated treatment. Root length density decreased exponentially with depth in both treatments, but relatively more fine roots grown in the elevated CO2 treatment tended to occur deeper in the soil profile.","Landcare Res Ltd, Canterbury 8152, New Zealand; Lincoln Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Canterbury, New Zealand; Univ Canterbury, New Zealand Forest Res Inst, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; New Zealand Inst Crop & Food Res Ltd, Hastings, New Zealand; CSIRO Land & Water, C QNDR, Indooroopilly, Qld 4074, Australia","Whitehead, D (reprint author), Landcare Res Ltd, POB 69, Canterbury 8152, New Zealand.",whiteheadd@landcare.cri.nz,"Reid, Jeff B/J-9726-2016; Thomas, Steve/F-2064-2013; Reid, James/C-9269-2013; Cook, Freeman/A-1238-2008","Reid, Jeff B/0000-0002-3269-7151; Thomas, Steve/0000-0002-9202-483X; Cook, Freeman/0000-0001-6044-2079",,,,68,38,43,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Many groups of invertebrates feed on subterranean plant parts, but insects and nematodes are the most important below-ground herbivores. Studies of interactions between below-ground herbivores have shown both competition and facilitation. Competition may be minimized through niche differentiation or by temporal or spatial avoidance. Studies have shown low levels of niche occupancy and no clear evidence for exclusive guilds or species packing. Facilitation may occur through substrate modification or the increased attractiveness of damaged roots to other herbivores. Specialist herbivores cause changes in plant community composition through their effects on specific host plants primarily as a result of the alteration of competitive interactions between coexisting plant species. Generalist herbivores can similarly affect plant community composition as a result of differences in their preference for plant species or differences in host plant susceptibility. Experimental studies have demonstrated the impact of below-ground herbivory on the rate and direction of vegetation succession, with belowground herbivores acting as keystone species in certain ecosystems. As a result of the focus of research on pest species or potential biological control agents, research has tended to focus on particular herbivore species and the effects on their host plant. This review shows that the role of below-ground herbivory in structuring plant communities and the interactions between such herbivores and other components of the biotic and physical environment of the soil remain important and fruitful areas for ecological research.","CABI Biosci UK Ctr Ascot, Ascot SL5 7TA, Berks, England","Mortimer, SR (reprint author), CABI Biosci UK Ctr Ascot, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7TA, Berks, England.",,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; Mortimer, Simon R/B-5154-2008","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; Mortimer, Simon R/0000-0001-6160-6741",,,,123,28,29,0,19,BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND",,,0-632-05155-8,,,,1999,,,,,,,205,238,,,,,34,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Entomology; Zoology,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Entomology; Zoology,BN25T,WOS:000081339000007,,,,,10/31/19S,"Zhou, GY",,,INT EROSION CONTROL ASSOC; INT EROSION CONTROL ASSOC,"Zhou, GY",,,"Relations between typhoon storm, root system and landslide",INTERNATIONAL EROSION CONTROL ASSOCIATION - PROCEEDINGS OF CONFERENCE 30,INTERNATIONAL EROSION CONTROL ASSOCIATION - PROCEEDINGS OF CONFERENCE,,English,Proceedings Paper,30th Conference of the International-Erosion-Control-Association,"FEB 22-26, 1999","NASHVILLE, TN",Int Erosion Control Assoc,,,,"The landslide caused by No. 9508 typhoon storm at Tianchi of Hainan's Jianfengling was investigated, the root systems of regenerated tropical mountain rain forest and young Chinese fir plantation were measured, and the relations between typhoon storm, root system and landslide were analyzed in the paper. The results indicated that: (1) During the No. 9508 typhoon storm, there were more than 20 landslides of which the largest one took up 320 m(2) area in the investigated 15 ha Chinese fir plantation land; however there was no landslide in the close tropical mountain rain forest land. The landslides occurred in the land with steep gradient (35 degrees-55 degrees). (2) The biomass of root per unit soil mass in the regenerated tropical mountain rain forest (17.72 kg/m(3) soil) was 4.76 times that in young Chinese fir plantation (3.72 kg/m3 soil). (3) The root mass each root diameter (d < 0.2, 0.2 < d < 0.5, 0.5 < d < 1, and d > 1 cm) in the regenerated,tropical mountain rain forest (young Chinese fir plantation) accounted for 14.0% (41.4%), 10.5% (22.4%), 28.1% (8.5%), and 47.4% (27.7%) respectively of the total root mass. (4) There were few dead roots in the regenerated tropical mountain rain forest and many dead roots (especially the large roots with diameter > 1.0 cm) in the young Chinese fir plantation. The dead root mass each root diameter (d < 0.2, 0.2 < d < 0.5, 0.5 < d < 1, and d > 1 cm) in the later forest accounted for 6.5%, 24.6%, 50.7%, and 92.9% respectively of the corresponding root class's total root mass. (5) Storms, especially typhoon storms with high rainfall and rainfall intensity was the outer factor that led to landslide, larger amounts of rainfall made soil moisture increase, soil mass soften, soil particles' coherent and friction decrease, and made shearing strength of soil decline. Also, the deforestation was an important inner factor of landslide, it caused root dead and resulted in decline and/or loss of function of soil conservation.","Res Inst Trop Forestry, CAF, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China","Zhou, GY (reprint author), Res Inst Trop Forestry, CAF, Guangzhou 510520, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,INT EROSION CONTROL ASSOC,STEAMBOAT SPRINGS,"PO BOX 4904, STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, CO 80477 USA",1092-2806,,,IECA P CONF,,,1999,30,,,,,,17,+,,,,,9,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science",Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Agriculture,BN21T,WOS:000081130600003,,,,,10/31/19S,"Marx, DH",,"Lemattre, M; Lemattre, P; Lemaire, F",,"Marx, DH",,,Mycorrhizal management in urban forestry,INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON URBAN TREE HEALTH,ACTA HORTICULTURAE,,English,Proceedings Paper,1st International Symposium on Urban Tree Health,"SEP 22-26, 1997","PARIS, FRANCE","Int Soc Hort Sci, INRA, French Soc Arboriculture, French Minist Foreign Off Agr Environm Culture Educ & Res",,mycorrhizae; bacteria; forest soil processes; commercial inoculants,,"Urban trees, forest trees once-removed, have the same biological needs as forest trees.

The questions raised in this study are whether seed plants obtain appropriate ectomycorrhiza while in the nursery, and whether this mycorrhization is maintained after transfer to the final habitat. Plants were analysed from two seed plant nurseries, two landscaping nurseries, and two street localities, representing a production line. Two natural self-sowing forests and one plantation forest habitat were used as reference. In each place, 5-10 trees were selected, 2-3 topsoil root systems sampled from each tree, and mycorrhizal root tips distributed into morphotypes. Percent mycorrhizae of total living root tips was above 75% in all localities, Forest habitats contained more morphotypes than the other localities. The dominating type in forest nurseries (1-2 year seedlings) did not occur consistently in older cultures and was absent in the street trees. Two morphotypes originated in the tree nurseries (3-12 years old trees); both reoccurred in the street trees, one with about the same incidence, the other much increased. Both types hardly occurred at all in the forest habitats. T. cordata proved to be highly mycorrhizal even in fertilized cultural systems and thus seems to be strongly dependent on mycorrhiza, although the importance of diversity in the symbionts is unknown. The data obtained suggest that strains vary in their persistence, when faced with environmental changes such as replanting and with the natural inoculum potential in the final habitat.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Ornamentals, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark","Nielsen, JS (reprint author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Ornamentals, Kirstinebjergvej 10, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark.",,"Rasmussen, Hanne N/P-5485-2014","Rasmussen, Hanne N/0000-0002-0181-9304",,,,12,0,3,0,7,INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,90-6605-981-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,1999,,496,,,,,451,459,,10.17660/ActaHortic.1999.496.56,,,9,Forestry; Horticulture,Forestry; Agriculture,BP49F,WOS:000085307900056,,,,,10/31/19J,"Chambers, JC; Blank, RR; Zamudio, DC; Tausch, RJ",,,,"Chambers, JC; Blank, RR; Zamudio, DC; Tausch, RJ",,,Central Nevada riparian areas: Physical and chemical properties of meadow soils,JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,water tables; watershed geology; soil morphology; soil quality; ecosystem classification; ecosystem condition,BEAVER,"Despite the importance of soil characteristics for classifying riparian ecosystem types and evaluating ecosystem or range condition, little information exists on western riparian area soils or the factors that influence them. We examined the effects of drainage basin geology and water table depth on soil morphology and soil physical and chemical properties of meadow sites in central Nevada. We described and analyzed the soils of meadows that occurred in 4 drainages with different geology and that exhibited high water tables (0 to -20 cm from the surface), intermediate water tables (-30 to -50 cm), and low water tables (-60 to -80 cm). Pedons of high water tables sites had thick O(e) horizons, dark, fine-textured A horizons, no B horizons, and lower C horizons high in coarse fragments. In contrast, pedons of low water tables sites were characterized by deep, dark and organic-rich A horizons, cambic B horizons, and deep rooting profiles. High water tables sites had higher organic matter, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and extractable potassium, but lower pH than low water table sites. Also, high water table sites had lower percentage sand, lower bulk densities, and higher soil moisture retention. The importance of organic matter was evidenced by strong positive product moment correlations for organic matter and total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and extractable potassium. Significant differences in pH, extractable potassium and extractable phosphorus existed among drainages that were explainable largely from the parent materials. Drainages with chert, quartzite, and limestone had higher silt and clay, neutral pH, and high levels of extractable phosphorus. Drainages formed in acidic volcanic tuffs, rhyolites and breccia were characterized by coarser textured soils and low pH and extractable phosphorus. In riparian areas, soil water table depth interacts with soil parent material to significantly affect soil morphology and soil physical and chemical properties. Because these factors vary over both large and small spatial scales, differences among sites must be carefully interpreted when classifying ecosystems or evaluating ecosystem condition.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Reno, NV 89512 USA; Agr Res Serv, USDA, Reno, NV 89512 USA; US Forest Serv, USDA, Humbolt Toiyabe Natl Forest, Sparks, NV 89431 USA","Chambers, JC (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Reno, NV 89512 USA.",,,,,,,32,18,18,0,12,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

The species composition and abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) may influence the ability of forests to provide suitable habitat for small mammals. Identification and interpretation of changes in the abundance of these organisms, or in their inter-relationships due to experimental harvest, require that we first identify the patterns and potential causes of natural variability in the pre-harvest communities. Pretreatment data were gathered from the Watson Falls block of a green-tree retention experiment to establish baseline conditions. The six experimental treatments that comprise this block lie in two spatially distinct areas that differ in environment and forest composition. The initial variability in EMF, small mammals, and their relationships was documented. Three primary questions are addressed in this paper: (1) Are the abundance and species composition of EMF sporocarps similar between the two areas of the Watson Falls block? (2) How does sporocarp consumption vary among small mammal species and by area? (3) For common truffle genera, is sporocarp biomass correlated with the spore frequency of these genera in small mammal diets? The Watson Falls block was found to have spatial and temporal variation in EMF production, small mammal mycophagy, and small mammal abundance. However, truffles were consistently the primary food item in the diet of all three small mammal species in this study. Small mammals are potentially important agents of truffle dispersal into disturbed areas where EMF are locally extirpated. This study furthers knowledge of the role of small mammal mycophagy in the functioning of forest ecosystems.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Cazares, E (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Peavy Hall 154, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,48,33,35,1,7,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,PULLMAN,"PO BOX 645020, PULLMAN, WA 99164-5910 USA",0029-344X,,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,,1999,73,,,,SI,,64,76,,,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,173KD,WOS:000078979000006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Krauss, J; Funke, W",,,,"Krauss, J; Funke, W",,,Extraordinary high density of Protura in a windfall area of young spruce plants,PEDOBIOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Protura; spruce; succession; mycorrhiza; abundance,SOIL,"In 1990 large spruce forests of Southern Germany were destroyed by the spring storms ""Vivian"" and ""Wiebke"".

This species has generally a poor stem straightness, especially when it grows in poor sandy podzol of the Landes Forest, affected by summer droughts and winter floods. Above- and below-ground architecture and biomass as well as stem straightness were measured on twenty-nine 5-year-old planted trees uprooted by pulling with a lumbering crane. A very precise numeric representation of the geometry and topology of structural root architecture was gained using a low-magnetic-field digitising device (Danjon et al., 1998; Sinoquet and Rivet, 1997). Data were analysed with AMAPmod, a database software designed to analyse plant topological structures (Godin et al., 1997). Several characteristics of root architecture were extracted by queries including root number, length, diameter, volume, spatial position, ramification order, branching angle and inter-laterals length. Differences between root systems originated from their dimensions, but also from the proportion of deep roots and the taproot size, which represented 8% of the total root volume. The proportion of root volume in the zone of rapid taper was negatively correlated with the proportion of root volume in the taproot indicating a compensation between taproot and main lateral root volume. Among all studied root characteristics the maximal rooting depth, the proportion of deep roots and the root partitioning coefficient were correlated with stem straightness.","INRA Croissance & Prod, F-33611 Gazinet, France; CIRAD, GERDAT, Unite Modelisat Plantes, F-34032 Rennes, France; INRA Ecophysiol & Nutr, F-33611 Gazinet, France","Danjon, F (reprint author), INRA Croissance & Prod, BP 45, F-33611 Gazinet, France.",,"Danjon, Frederic/F-1557-2011; Godin, Christophe/C-1218-2008","Danjon, Frederic/0000-0002-9104-9808; Godin, Christophe/0000-0002-1202-8460",,,,56,61,66,0,18,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,217,2-Jan,,,,,49,63,,10.1023/A:1004686119796,,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,270JR,WOS:000084532600005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Sundstrom, E; Keane, M",,,,"Sundstrom, E; Keane, M",,,"Root architecture, early development and basal sweep in containerized and bare-rooted Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,architecture; bare root; basal sweep; container; dominant root; Douglas fir; root; symmetry,SITKA SPRUCE; GROWTH; SEEDLINGS; SYSTEM,"Seedlings grown in containers often have deformed, spiralling, kinking root systems (reported especially in pine growing in colder climates like Fenno-Scandinavia). The current study examines the effect of containers on the root systems of Douglas fir planted in Ireland. A sample of sixteen 10-year-old Douglas fir trees, planted as either bare-rooted transplants (2/1) or containerized seedlings (Paperpot 610 (2/0)) on an acid brown earth site in Ireland, were excavated for root achitectural studies. In addition to thorough above-ground measurements, an assessment of basal sweep was also carried out. Root systems were systematically described and horizontal angles, cross-sectional areas (CSA), and maximum depths of all roots >5 mm in diameter were recorded. Various biomass ratios and estimates for dominant roots were also calculated. Symmetry of the root systems, max. and min. numbers, and CSA of roots for sectors of various sizes were compared for the two plant types. The initially (when planted) bigger bare-rooted transplants were still larger than the container-planted trees after ten years. Of the total above-ground fresh weight, the container stock had allocated more to the crown and less to the stem compared to bare-roots. The difference in root weights between stock types was small. Basal sweep occurred on average in 50% of the bare-roots and 35% of the container trees. The direction of the basal sweep leaning was concentrated to the NE, which coincided with the direction of the slope and the prevailing wind direction. No effect of planting position in relation to the direction of site preparation was found for basal sweep. The size of the root system, fresh weight and total cross-sectional area was on average for all trees correlated to both DBH and shoot fresh weights. For containers separately, however, only root area was correlated to DBH and stem fresh weight. In spite of the difference in the above-ground size, there were no significant differences in root numbers and root area (CSA) between the two plant types. No difference in rooting depth between plant types was found. When splitting the root system into 120 degrees horizontal sectors (1/3 of the root system) the highest numbers of roots were concentrated in the NW direction. The highest amount of root area tended to be concentrated along a NW-SE diagonal, with a dominance for the latter (SE). Sectors without dominant roots (expected to be the future main structural, stabilizing roots), varied in size (94-178 degrees) but were on average wider in bare-roots and on average concentrated in the NE direction and the downhill side of the slope.","FoReCo, S-90336 Umea, Sweden; Coillte Teoranta, Res & Dev, Newtownmountkennedy, Co Wicklow, Ireland","Sundstrom, E (reprint author), FoReCo, Plangatan 5, S-90336 Umea, Sweden.",,,,,,,43,18,21,0,5,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,217,2-Jan,,,,,65,78,,10.1023/A:1004693031375,,,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,270JR,WOS:000084532600006,,,,,10/31/19J,"Drexhage, M; Huber, F; Colin, F",,,,"Drexhage, M; Huber, F; Colin, F",,,Comparison of radial increment and volume growth in stems and roots of Quercus petraea,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass partitioning; dendrochronology; radial growth; radial increment; root growth; Quercus petraea,OAK; SYSTEMS; SPRUCE; TREES; RINGS; ROBUR,"Dendrochronological studies dealing with roots, stems and branches are very rare or often take the form of short notes. The difficulties of detecting rings and of quantifying the radial growth in roots have already been described for various species. In oak the anatomical root structure differs from stemwood. The roots are radial-porous or diffuse-porous, and there is often no clear distinction between individual rings. In our study visual and radiographic techniques were used to examine radial increment in roots of sessile oak (Quercus petraea L.) which was compared with radial growth in branches and along the stem. Coarse roots were cut from four 30- to 34-year-old trees that had been uprooted mechanically and disks were taken at different distances from the stem-root base. Ring widths were measured in the stem at height of 0.3 m, at breast height (1.3 m), beneath the crown, in branches of the crown, and in roots every 20 cm. The ring widths were cross-dated, and the heterogeneity of growth within a root and within the root system were analysed. Asymmetric growth frequently occurred in roots so that ovals, I-beam and T-beam shapes were developed. With the method used in our study the annual growth layers close to the central cylinder could be distinguished as well as beneath the bark. Pointer years were detected in all sections of the tree and permitted correction of ring widths in roots. Root system, stem and branch showed a basic similarity in their radial sequence of ring width. The annual biomass increment was weaker and more variable with several consecutive changes in the roots than in the stems. The root/shoot ratio reached a minimum rather early, beginning at the cambial age of 20 years.","INRA, Ctr Nancy, Unite Croissance Prod & Qual Bois, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Drexhage, M (reprint author), INRA, Ctr Nancy, Unite Croissance Prod & Qual Bois, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",,"Colin, Francis/H-4917-2012",,,,,34,16,16,1,23,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,217,2-Jan,,,,,101,110,,10.1023/A:1004647418616,,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,270JR,WOS:000084532600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Fisher, JB; Jayachandran, K",,,,"Fisher, JB; Jayachandran, K",,,Root structure and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of the palm Serenoa repens under field conditions,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizae; palms; root anatomy; root architecture; Serenoa; soil profiles,ELAEIS-GUINEENSIS JACQ; MORPHOLOGY,"Serenoa repens (Bartr.) Small is a palm native to the southeastern USA. It is a common understory plant in pine communities on both acid sands and alkaline limestone. Roots have only primary growth and range in thickness from 8.0 mm (first order roots from the stem) to 0.8-2.9 mm (ultimate roots of third to fifth order). The thickest roots occur at soil depths > 20 cm; fine roots (< 1.2 mm) occur at all depths (1-60 cm). Some second and third order roots are negatively geotropic and grow up to the mineral soil surface. The epidermis of all roots has a thick, eventually lignified outer wall. Except for the thinnest, all roots have a single-layered, thick-walled exodermis, which is first suberized and later lignified. Root hairs are never present. A hypodermis composed of several layers of lignified cells (up to 8-cells-thick) is next to the exodermis and forms the outer cortex. Radial series of thin walled and slightly lignified cells sporadically occur in the outer cortex of the thinnest roots, but there are no passage cells in the exodermis, which is continuous. The remaining inner cortex is composed of unlignified parenchyma with air canals and a completely lignosuberized endodermis in old roots. Passage cells were seen the the endodermis of the some of the thinnest roots. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi occur in the outer one-third of the cortical parenchyma adjacent to the hypodermis. Fungal coils, arbuscules and vesicles are found most frequently in the thinnest roots, but also occur sporadically in all root orders. Cells a few mm from the apical meristem are sometimes colonized. At sites of appressoria, coils of AM hyphae occur within an epidermal cell and exodermal and hypodermal cells beneath. Intercellular hyphae with intracellular branch arbuscules (Arum-type) are common in the inner cortex. There is evidence of a dieback of the highest order roots during the winter dry season. Profiles of soil and roots have the highest density of AM spores in the surface 10 cm layer. Total AM spore density ranged from 130 to 1100 spores per 50 g soil in different samples. Glomus spp. dominated followed by Gigaspora spp. The findings are related to a more general understanding of growth and AM colonization in long-lived roots of tropical woody monocotyledons. Palm roots, in particular, are slow growing and are protected by massive hypodermal layers.","Fairchild Trop Garden, Miami, FL 33156 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Florida Int Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Miami, FL 33199 USA; Florida Int Univ, SE Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Fisher, JB (reprint author), Fairchild Trop Garden, 11935 Old Cutler Rd, Miami, FL 33156 USA.",fisherj@fiu.edu,,,,,,28,21,27,0,6,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,217,2-Jan,,,,,229,241,,10.1023/A:1004576001334,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,270JR,WOS:000084532600021,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wulfsohn, D; Nyengaard, JR; Gundersen, HJG; Cutler, AJ; Squires, TM",,,,"Wulfsohn, D; Nyengaard, JR; Gundersen, HJG; Cutler, AJ; Squires, TM",,,"Non-destructive, stereological estimation of plant root lengths, branching pattern and diameter distribution",PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agropyron cristatum L .; growth curves; total vertical projections; unbiased stereology; variability,TOTAL VERTICAL PROJECTIONS; UNBIASED ESTIMATION; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; SCANNER; QUANTIFICATION; SECTIONS; CURVE,"The total length of a linear structure contained in an unbounded, transparent reference space can be estimated from 'total vertical projections' obtained by rotating the linear structure about an arbitrary 'vertical' axis, and projecting the linear structure onto a plane parallel to the axis of rotation.

In this study, a stereological procedure based on the method of 'total vertical projections' was used to non-destructively estimate total root length, number of branches, diameter distribution and mean root diameter of crested wheatgrass plants (Agropyron cristatum L.) growing in a transparent medium. Root lengths, diameters, and number of branching points of various orders were determined at 3-day intervals over a 4-week growing period. The length estimator was very robust and efficient with sampling coefficients of error usually less than 5% for a total of 50-150 grid intersection counts over two projection directions per plant.

For the present paper, data collected in early summer 1987 were used to study the relation of fine root density and proximity to the nearest tree or the dominant tree. A large number of samples (37 in one site and 55 in another) was collected in a small plot (10 x 11 m). Two distances were measured at each sampling point: the distance to the nearest tree and the distance to the tree with a dominant crown above that point. There was large variability in fine root density in the samples. Tests with different regression models showed a distinct rooting pattern for one of the two locations. It is concluded that systematic errors in the assessment of fine root density can arise when sampling points are chosen at a constant distance from trees. For Douglas-fir, this systematic error could have been an overestimation of the fine root density by up to 10%. These systematic errors can be avoided easily, using a stratified random design or a random sampling design. When trees are spaced irregularly, a grid sampling design is also appropriate.","Inst Forestry & Nat Res, IBN, DLO, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; SC DLO, Winand Staring Ctr, NL-6700 AC Wageningen, Netherlands; DLO, CPRO, Ctr Biometry, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Olsthoorn, AFM (reprint author), Inst Forestry & Nat Res, IBN, DLO, POB 23, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"Klap, Jaco M/L-3512-2013","Klap, Jaco M/0000-0003-1188-3008",,,,34,4,9,0,9,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,211,2,,,,,215,221,,10.1023/A:1004624707774,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,261PX,WOS:000084018600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"Makkonen, K; Helmisaari, HS",,,,"Makkonen, K; Helmisaari, HS",,,Assessing fine-root biomass and production in a Scots pine stand - comparison of soil core and root ingrowth core methods,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,biomass; fine-root; ingrowth core method; production; Scots pine; soil core method,SYLVESTRIS L STAND; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; TURNOVER; GROWTH; DECOMPOSITION; DYNAMICS; SITES,"Soil core and root ingrowth core methods for assessing fine-root (< 2 mm) biomass and production were compared in a 38-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) stand in eastern Finland. 140 soil cores and 114 ingrowth cores were taken from two mineral soil layers (0-10 cm and 10-30 cm) during 1985-1988. Seasonal changes in root biomass (including both Scots pine and understorey roots) and necromass were used for calculating fine-root production. The Scots pine fine-root biomass averaged annually 143 g/m(2) and 217 g/m(2) in the upper mineral soil layer, and 118 g/m(2) and 66 g/m(2) in the lower layer of soil cores and ingrowth cores, respectively. The fine-root necromass averaged annually 601 g/m(2) and 311 g/m(2) in the upper mineral soil layer, and 196 g/m(2) and 159 g/m(2) in the lower layer of soil cores and ingrowth cores, respectively. The annual fine-root production in a Scots pine stand in the 30 cm thick mineral soil layer, varied between 370-1630 g/m(2) in soil cores and between 210 - 490 g/m(2) in ingrowth cores during three years. The annual production calculated for Scots pine fine roots, varied between 330-950 g/m(2) in soil cores and between 110 - 610 g/m(2) in ingrowth cores. The horizontal and vertical variation in fine-root biomass was smaller in soil cores than in ingrowth cores. Roots in soil cores were in the natural dynamic state, while the roots in the ingrowth cores were still expanding both horizontally and vertically. The annual production of fine-root biomass in the Scots pine stand was less in root ingrowth cores than in soil cores. During the third year, the fine-root biomass production of Scots pine, when calculated by the ingrowth core method, was similar to that calculated by the soil core method. Both techniques have sources of error. In this research the sampling interval in the soil core method was 6-8 weeks, and thus root growth and death between sampling dates could not be accurately estimated. In the ingrowth core method, fine roots were still growing into the mesh bags. In Finnish conditions, after more than three growing seasons, roots in the ingrowth cores can be compared with those in the surrounding soil. The soil core method can be used for studying both the annual and seasonal biomass variations. For estimation of production, sampling should be done at short intervals. The ingrowth core method is more suitable for estimating the potential of annual fine-root production between different site types.","Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Ctr, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland","Makkonen, K (reprint author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, Vantaa Res Ctr, POB 18, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland.",,,,,,,35,70,74,2,34,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,210,1,,,,,43,50,,10.1023/A:1004629212604,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,235FU,WOS:000082531300005,,,,,10/31/19J,"Mark, GL; Cassells, AC",,,,"Mark, GL; Cassells, AC",,,The effect of dazomet and fosetyl-Aluminium on indigenous and introduced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in commercial strawberry production,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; dazomet; fosetyl-Al; soil fumigation; strawberry; succinate dehydrogenase activity,ACID-INFERTILE SOILS; ROOT EXUDATION; PHYTOPHTHORA-FRAGARIAE; SAVANNA ECOSYSTEM; PHOSPHORUS; AL; COLONIZATION; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT,"Field and outdoor pot trials were conducted to assess the compatibility of an introduced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) isolate Glomus fistulosum ([Skou and Jakobsen sp. nov.] BEG 31) and indigenous AMF isolate/s, with biocides frequently used in commercial strawberry production, namely dazomet and fosetyl-Al (fosetyl aluminium). In the field trial, 'Elsanta' plants did not exhibit any mycorrhizal colonisation by indigenous AMF spp. after soil fumigation with dazomet. Recolonisation by indigenous AMF was low one year after soil fumigation and was possibly as a result of viable indigenous AMF propagules being washed in from adjacent non-fumigated fields. The degree of colonisation by the introduced AMF isolate G. fistulosum decreased by approximately 1/2 of its original value after one year in the field. Despite fosetyl-Al application Phytophthora fragariae Hickman infection was still prevalent in 'Elsanta' during the trial. Although fosetyl-Al did not significantly affect mycorrhizal colonisation, % total G. fistulosum root length colonisation and the proportion of it that was arbuscular, significantly decreased with increased sampling time. In the pot trial, foliar applications of fosetyl-Al significantly reduced the percentage of AMF colonisation that was vesicular and this was independent of the number of spray applications.

We non-destructively censused earthworm communities in each of 24 1.2 m(2) experimental plots in autumn 1996 when soils were wet and earthworms were active. Each plot contained an experimental plant community with 31, 12 or 5 native plant species (eight plots each). Half of the plots in each species treatment were exposed to ambient CO2 concentrations (350 mu L CO2 L-1) and half to elevated CO2 (600 mu L CO2 L-1) using screen-aided CO2 control. The study was conducted in the fourth year after community establishment and the third year of CO2 treatment as part of a long-term study on the interactive effects of plant species' loss and elevated CO2 on grassland communities. The size (density and biomass) of earthworm communities declined linearly when the number of plant species in the community was reduced from 31 to 5 species (e.g. 32 +/- 1 g m(-2) to 23 +/- 2 g m(-2)) due mainly to a decline in the endogeic worm species Allolobophora rosea which was the most abundant of nine earthworm species observed (nearly half of all worms in each plot). However, no changes in the relative contribution of individual species or the three main earthworm ecological groups (anecics, endogeics, epigeics) to the entire earthworm community were observed with declining number of plant species. The responses of earthworm communities to plant species' loss appear to reflect changes in community fine root biomass in the topsoil (e.g. declining worm biomass with declining fine root biomass) observed in parallel studies conducted at this site. Further the results of this study demonstrate that a loss of plant species' from these calcareous grassland communities may also alter the age structure of earthworm communities, but not significantly influence their diversity or composition. Our data also indicate that rising atmospheric CO2 may not greatly impact the size and composition of worm communities or alter the effects of plant species' loss on earthworm communities. Therefore, the disappearance of plant species from these native grasslands, as a result of ever increasing human activities, may be expected to lead to reductions in the size of earthworm communities and the ecosystem services they provide.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Zaller, JG (reprint author), Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, 5205 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",,"Zaller, Johann G/A-9914-2009","Zaller, Johann G/0000-0001-7744-7378",,,,34,31,36,2,34,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,208,1,,,,,1,8,,10.1023/A:1004424720523,,,8,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,200YB,WOS:000080566900001,,,,,10/31/19J,"Atkinson, CJ; Policarpo, M; Webster, AD; Kuden, AM",,,,"Atkinson, CJ; Policarpo, M; Webster, AD; Kuden, AM",,,Drought tolerance of apple rootstocks: Production and partitioning of dry matter,PLANT AND SOIL,,,English,Article,,,,,,apple; drought stress; irrigation; Malus domestica Borkh.; rootstock; water deficits,COXS ORANGE-PIPPIN; WATER RELATIONS; IRRIGATION; GROWTH; SEEDLINGS; QUALITY; NURSERY; STRESS; YIELD,"The drought tolerance of the commercial apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) rootstocks M9, M26, M27 and MM111, and some new selections from the rootstock breeding programme at HRI-East Malling (AR69-7, AR295-6, AR360-19, AR486-1 and AR628-2), was assessed using potted, glasshouse-grown, unworked rootstocks. After an initial period of growth under well-watered conditions the amount of irrigation was gradually reduced, for some treatments, to simulate natural drying in the soil. At the end of a six-month growth period, the rootstocks were harvested and the production of dry matter and its partitioning to various plant parts determined. The rootstocks exhibited large differences in shoot and root dry matter, and root length but not all the rootstocks showed declines in root mass or length in response to the droughting treatment. The dwarfing rootstocks tended to have smaller amounts of both coarse (>2 mm diameter) and fine roots (<2 mm diameter), than the more vigorous rootstocks. Irrespective of rootstock or irrigation treatment there was a close linear relationship between coarse and fine root. There was also no change in the length/weight relationship for fine roots irrespective of rootstock or irrigation treatment, i.e. 42 m of fine root weighed 1 g dry weight. In some cases the amount of root produced could be directly correlated with the rootstock known potential to control scion vigour, but this was not true for all the rootstocks examined. The absence of this relationship was particularly evident in some of the new selections of rootstock. The possible causes for these differences, compared with commercially used rootstocks, is discussed in relation to the origin and parentage of the rootstock selections.

The different responses of these rootstocks to drought are discussed along with their implications for understanding the mechanisms by which rootstocks are thought to dwarf scion shoots.","Hort Res Int, Maidstone ME19 6BJ, Kent, England; CU Ziraat Fak, Bahce Bitkileri Bolumu, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey; Univ Palermo, Ist Coltivaz Arboree, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Atkinson, CJ (reprint author), Hort Res Int, E Malling, W Malling, Maidstone ME19 6BJ, Kent, England.",Chris.Atkinson@hri.ac.uk,,,,,,32,30,36,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,,1999,206,2,,,,,223,235,,,,,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,194FX,WOS:000080182400010,,,,,10/31/19S,"Herrick, JE",,"Meurisse, RT; Ypsilantis, WG; Seybold, C",,"Herrick, JE",,,Soil organisms and rangeland soil hydrological functions,PROCEEDINGS: PACIFIC NORTHWEST FOREST AND RANGELAND SOIL ORGANISM SYMPOSIUM,USDA FOREST SERVICE GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PACIFIC NORTHWEST,,English,Proceedings Paper,Pacific Northwest Forest and Rangeland Soil Organism Symposium,"MAR 17-19, 1998","CORVALLIS, OR","USDA Forest Serv, Pacific NW Reg, USDI Bur Land Management, USDA Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Soil Qual Inst, Oregon State Univ, Oregon Soc Soil Scientists",,hydrology; infiltration; soil water; available water holding capacity; invertebrate; ant; termite; earthworm; fungi; rangeland; soil structure; aggregate; soil organic matter,SEMIARID EASTERN AUSTRALIA; NEST ENTRANCES; SANDY SOILS; WATER; ANTS; INFILTRATION; TERMITES; DESERT; DESERTIFICATION; LANDSCAPES,"Soil organisms control water distribution in rangelands by creating macropores which rapidly conduct water into the soil, by generating stable soil aggregates which prevent crusting and increase water holding capacity, and by controlling litter decomposition. Ants, termites and earthworms have all been shown to increase infiltration capacity; anecdotal evidence suggests that macropore formation by a variety of other macroinvertebrates may have equally dramatic effects. Macroinvertebrates generate aggregates in the form of fecal pellets. Lichens, mycorrhizal fungi, cyanobacteria and other microorganisms also contribute to aggregate formation and soil surface stabilization. The direct effects of rapid litter decomposition on infiltration and soil water storage in arid and semi-arid rangelands is generally negative: litter removal exposes the surface to raindrop impact, which leads to the formation of physical crusts, and increases evaporation from the soil surface. These negative impacts are balanced by the creation of surface-connected macropores and the incorporation of soil organic matter, resulting in the formation of stable aggregates.","USDA ARS, Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Herrick, JE (reprint author), USDA ARS, Jornada Expt Range, POB 30003,MSC 3JER, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",jherrick@nmsu.edu,,,,,,48,0,0,0,9,"US DEPT AGR, FOREST SERV PACIFIC NW RESEARCH STN",PORTLAND,"319 SW PINE ST, PO BOX 3890, PORTLAND, OR 97208 USA",0363-6224,,,US FOR SERV T R PNW,USDA For.

Karst.) seedlings were planted on 2-, 3- and 4-yr-old clear-cuttings. At the time of planting, the ground vegetation on the clear-cuttings was dominated by the grass Deschampsia flexuosa. Effects of various site preparation treatments (mounding and herbicide) were analysed during the first 3 yrs after planting. After the third growing season, seedling dry mass was significantly higher in the herbicide and mound treatments than in the control, but then was no significant difference between the herbicide and mound treatments. During a drought period in August 1995, soil water potentials were lower in untreated plots and in mounds than in the herbicide treatment, but seedling water potentials showed no evidence of water stress. The hypothesis that seedling growth was supported by water taken up from beneath the rooting zone of the ground vegetation during droughts was tested in two ways. By studying the relation between the root morphology of planted seedlings and the rooting density of the ground vegetation, and by comparing the natural abundance of an isotope of oxygen (O-18) in seedling xylem water with its abundance at various depths in the soil profile. More than 70% of the total root biomass of the ground vegetation was in the top 15 cm of the soil profile. Although the planted seedlings also had the major part of their root system in the top 15 cm, each seedling also had at least one sinker root extending down to greater depths, where the rooting density of the ground vegetation was low. Soil water from the topsoil had a significantly higher delta(18)O than water from the subsoil, but its delta(18)O was about the same as or lower than that of xylem water. Therefore, it was concluded that seedlings took up water mainly from the topsoil, irrespective of the treatment, and the above hypothesis was rejected.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Nilsson, U (reprint author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Box 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",,,,,,,23,18,18,1,17,SCANDINAVIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS,OSLO,"PO BOX 2959 TOYEN, JOURNAL DIVISION CUSTOMER SERVICE, N-0608 OSLO, NORWAY",0282-7581,,,SCAND J FOREST RES,Scand.

The design included 20 families, with seven clones per family and an average of seven ramets per clone. Five traits: height, root score, root-shoot ratio, root weight and shoot weight, were measured at nine months after planting (setting). Early growth in cuttings was found to be affected by genotype and stock-plant age and an interaction between these two effects. Cutting performance was found to decline with increasing stock-plant age, with the cuttings taken from 2 year old stock-plants showing superior growth for all traits. Cuttings harvested from stock-plants raised as seedlings showed superior growth compared to cuttings propagated from stock-plants raised as harvested seedling stock plants (seedling stock plants previously harvest ed for microcuttings) and stock-plants raised as microcuttings. Seedlings displayed superior growth compared to microcuttings. Heritabilities were moderate for height and root-shoot ratio, and low for root and shoot weight and root score. The ranking of families was found to vary with increasing stock plant age. It is recommended that selection and deployment of genetic material is made using cuttings from the same stock-plant ages to ensure that family or clonal ranking is not adversely affected.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Cooperat Res Ctr Sustainable Prod Forestry, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","McGranahan, MF (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Plant Sci, GPO Box 252-55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",,,,,,,18,6,7,0,3,SAUERLANDERS VERLAG,FRANKFURT,"FINKENHOFSTRASSE 21, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",0037-5349,,,SILVAE GENET,Silvae Genet.,,1999,48,6,,,,,267,272,,,,,6,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,Forestry; Genetics & Heredity,324HZ,WOS:000087617400002,,,,,10/31/19J,"North, M; Greenberg, J",,,,"North, M; Greenberg, J",,,Stand conditions associated with truffle abundance in western hemlock/Douglas-fir forests,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elaphomyces granulatus; hypogeous sporocarps; Pacific Northwest; Rhizopogon parksii; Ripley's K analysis; soil organic layer; truffles,MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; HYPOGEOUS FUNGI; OREGON; SPOROCARPS; PLANTATIONS; ECOSYSTEMS; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; GROWTH,"Truffles are a staple food source for many forest small mammals yet the vegetation or soil conditions associated with truffle abundance are unknown. We examined the spatial distribution of forest structures, organic layer depth, root density, and two of the most common western North American truffles (Elaphomyces granulatus and Rhizopogon parksii), in managed-young, natural-mature and old-growth western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)/Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands in Washington State. Forest conditions, E. granulatus and R. parksii sporocarp locations were mapped and analyzed using ARC/INFO. Spatial patterns were assessed with univariate and bivariate Ripley's K analysis, which measures the scale at which one and two sets of points, respectively, are 'attracted' or 'repelled'. R. parksii truffles were not associated with organic layer depth, root density or forest structure. E. granulatus truffles were distributed in widely-spaced, high-biomass clusters which are significantly associated with thick organic layers with a high density of fine roots. E. granulatus truffles were significantly distanced from trees at 1-2 m. No other associations were found between E. granulatus truffles, logs, ferns or shrubs. Although E. granulatus comprised more than 90% of the total truffle biomass in these unmanaged mature and old-growth stands, in managed-young stands, E. granulatus truffles were rare and total truffle biomass was low. In managed-young stands, organic layer depth and fine root density have been significantly reduced with the introduction of fire. Slash burning and soil scarification practices in these forests may have a strong affect on local food abundance and availability of the most common truffle for small mammal consumers.

There were significant differences among mother trees in the biomass of their seeds (mother tree level accounted for 62% of total variance in this trait), in the percentage of seedlings that emerged and in the time of shoot emergence. The progeny that had high emergence rates (80-90%) also had shea emergence times while the opposite was true for the progeny that had low (43%) and intermediate (70%) emergence rates. Acorn biomass covaried significantly with seedling total biomass and with the biomass of different parts of the seedlings, but not with the partitioning of biomass among roots and shoots (root/shoot ratio) nor to morphological seedling traits such as shoot height, total leaf area, average leaf size, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf number. All these traits varied significantly among the seedlings produced by different mother trees. The conductance to water vapour (gi,) of the foliage of the seedlings also varied significantly among mother trees and was dependent on the root/shoot ratio as on the total leaf area of the seedlings, but not on the total seedling biomass. One of the six trees that were studied produced seedlings which had a significantly higher root/shoot ratio, smaller leaf area, smaller leaves, higher specific leaf area and shorter stems than the seedlings produced by any other tree. In addition, the former set of seedlings had significantly higher g(1w) 15 and 30 days after drought, and higher leaf water content at the end of the experiment than the other seedlings. We discuss the value of using single seedling traits related to drought tolerance such as root/shoot ratio and leaf area in the framework of the restoration of savannah-like oak forest in the Mediterranean areas. We also discuss the functional implications of the diversity of genotypes within the oak populations in the framework of the global climate change.

In this paper, a new approach for modelling the daily allocation of carbon and nitrogen is presented. It is based on the sink strength of each plant compartment. A relative carbon demand is calculated for each tree compartment based on its relationship to foliage biomass. The demand is zero when the ratio between both meets an optimum value, which itself is not constant but shifts according to the relative supply of water and nitrogen (i.e., the fine root to foliage ratio), or to tree height and crown length (sapwood/foliage ratio). The ratios between the compartments become unbalanced when carbon is relocated from the reserve pool to foliage during shoot growth, and when the mortality rates of specific tissues change according to the actual environmental conditions. Considering these principles, a dynamic carbon allocation scheme was developed that realistically reflects the effects of climatic conditions as well as changing allocation patterns due to changing tree dimensions. Three Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in eastern Germany, which were under investigation in the framework of an integrated impact study (SANA), are used to evaluate the new approach. It was possible to simulate the daily dynamics of growth and mortality in the different compartments, using the actual environmental conditions in the three stands during the years 1994 and 1995. The approach is discussed with respect to influences of climate change, air pollution and deposition on forest development. It is concluded that more attention should be devoted to the description of the dynamics of allocation and mortality processes in forest growth models.

Seven years after the first cutting, fresh mass, length, and diameter of the roots of sprout-origin B. pendula were smaller than those of seed-origin ones. After the: cutting of the experimental season, the root system did not develop new structural root tips. When both root pruning and stem cutting were performed, stumps sprouted well by July, but the number of sprouts decreased clearly by August. The positive effect of stem cutting on sprouting disappears in a few years in these species. As the size of the root system does not clearly influence the growth of sprouts, the competition of root systems of adjacent trees does not restrict the shoot growth of birch plants at: least in planted birches up to about 10 years of age.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90570 Oulu, Finland","Paukkonen, K (reprint author), Univ Joensuu, Fac Forestry, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",katri.paukkonen@forest.joensuu.fi; anneli.kauppi@oulu.fi,,,,,,48,9,12,0,11,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

The annual total of net leaf photosynthesis was 110% more in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2. However, the trees in elevated COP grew only 59% more biomass than the trees in ambient COP over the year. Modelling studies showed that larger loss of carbon from fine-root production and growth of the root-associated mycorrhiza by the trees in elevated CO2 probably accounted for all the remaining difference in net photosynthesis between the two treatments. Our modelling also showed that the fraction of net photosynthate consumed by respiration of nonleaf tissue was similar in the two CO2 treatments, and was 26% and 24% for trees in ambient and elevated CO2, respectively. Trees in elevated CO2 had 43% more leaves, and produced 110% more net photosynthate than trees in ambient CO2, even though the maximum rate of carboxylation per unit leaf nitrogen decreased by 21%. Sensitivity studies showed that down-regulation reduced the annual net photosynthetic production of the trees in elevated CO2 by only 6%.

After six months exposure to elevated CO2, root production measured by root in-growth bags, showed significant increases in mean total root length and biomass, which were more than 100% greater compared to the ambient treatment. This increased root length may have lead to a more intensive soil exploration. Chemical analysis of the roofs showed that the roots in the elevated treatment accumulated more starch and had a lower C/N-ratio. Specific root respiration rates were significantly higher in the elevated treatment and this was probably attributed to increased nitrogen concentrations in the roots. Rhizospheric respiration and soil CO2 efflux were also enhanced in the elevated treatment. These results clearly indicate that under elevated atmospheric CO2 root production and development in Scots pine seedlings is altered and respiratory carbon losses through the root system are increased.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Univ Sussex, Dept Biol Sci, Brighton BN1 9QG, E Sussex, England","Janssens, IA (reprint author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Plein 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",ijanssen@uia.ua.ac.be,"Duroux, Meg/D-1522-2009; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016","Duroux, Meg/0000-0001-9457-2429; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358; Taylor, Gail/0000-0001-8470-6390",,,,62,80,97,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Source-sink interactions, particularly with regard to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), are key determinants of PS acclimation to elevated [CO2] at the whole-plant level. In the long term, PS and growth response to [CO2] are dependent on genotypic and environmental factors affecting the plant's ability to develop new sinks for C, and acquire adequate N and other resources to support an enhanced growth potential. Growth at elevated [CO2] usually increases N use efficiency because PS rates can be maintained at levels comparable to those observed at ambient [CO2] with less N investment in PS enzymes. A frequent acclimation response, particularly under N-limited conditions, is for the accumulation of leaf carbohydrates at elevated [CO2] to lead to repression of genes associated with the production of PS enzymes. The hypothesis that this is an adaptive response, leading to a diversion of N to plant organs where it is of greatest benefit in terms of competitive ability and reproductive fitness, needs to be more rigorously tested. The biological control mechanisms which plants have evolved to acclimate to shifts in source-sink balance caused by elevated [CO2] are complex, and will only be fully elucidated by probing at all scales along the hierarchy from molecular to ecosystem. Use of environmental manipulations and genotypic comparisons will facilitate the testing of specific hypotheses. Improving our ability to predict PS acclimation to [CO2] will require the integration of results from laboratory studies using simple model systems with results from whole-plant studies that include measurements of processes operating at several scales.","Cornell Univ, Dept Fruit & Vegetable Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; CSIRO, Div Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO, Div Wildlife & Ecol, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia; Univ Nevada, Desert Res Inst, Reno, NV 89509 USA","Wolfe, DW (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Fruit & Vegetable Sci, 168 Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",dww5@cornell.edu,"Hilbert, David/A-3796-2008",,,,,139,81,85,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Using compartments accessible only to AMF hyphae but not to roots, we also tested whether elevated CO2 affects the growth of external AMF hyphae. Plant biomass was significantly greater at elevated than at ambient CO2; the biomass of the root system, for example, increased by a factor of 2. The colonization of AMF inside the root remained constant, indicating that the total AMF inside the root system also increased by a factor of 2. The length of external AMF hyphae at elevated CO2 was up to 5 times that at ambient CO2, indicating that elevated CO2 promoted allocation of AMF biomass to the external hyphae. The concentration and content of phosphorus in the stolons differed significantly between ambient and elevated CO2 but this resulted in either an increase or a decrease, according to which AMF isolate occupied the roots. We hypothesized that an increase in external hyphal growth at elevated CO2 would result in increased P acquistion by the plant. To test this we supplied phosphorus, in a compartment only accessible to AMF hyphae. Plants did not acquire more phosphorus at elevated CO2 when phosphorus was added to this compartment. Large increases in AMF hyphal growth could, however? play a significant role in the movement of fixed carbon to the soil and increase soil aggregation.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Sanders, IR (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Hebelstr 1, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",Sanders@ubaclu.unibas.ch,"Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017; van der Heijden, Marcel G.A./H-5243-2011; Boller, Thomas/G-3500-2012","Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214; Boller, Thomas/0000-0001-6768-7503",,,,23,53,56,4,33,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1998,117,4,,,,,496,503,,10.1007/s004420050685,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157XF,WOS:000078086400006,28307674,,,,10/31/19J,"Dodd, MB; Lauenroth, WK; Welker, JM",,,,"Dodd, MB; Lauenroth, WK; Welker, JM",,,Differential water resource use by herbaceous and woody plant life-forms in a shortgrass steppe community,OECOLOGIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,plant functional types; selective removal; shortgrass steppe; soil water; stable isotopes,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; SOIL-WATER; RAINFALL EVENTS; DESERT PLANTS; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; SHRUBS; TREES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SAVANNA,"We conducted a study to test the predictions of Waiter's two-layer model in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. The model suggests that grasses and woody plants use water resources from different layers of the soil profile. Four plant removal treatments were applied in the spring of 1996 within a plant community codominated by Atriplex canescens (a C-4 shrub) and Bouteloua gracilis (a C-4 grass). During the subsequent growing season, soil water content was monitored to a depth of 180 cm. In addition, stern and leaf tissue of Atriplex, Bouteloua and the streamside tree Populus sargentii were collected monthly during the owing seasons of 1995 and 1996 for analysis of the delta(18)O value of plant stem water (for comparison with potential water sources) and the delta(13)C value of leaves (as an indicator of plant water status). Selective removal of shrubs did not significantly increase water storage at any depth in the measured soil profile. Selective removal of the herbaceous understory (mainly grasses) increased water storage in the top 60 cm of the soil. Some of this water gradually percolated to lower layers, where it was utilized by the shrubs. Based on stem water delta(18)O values, grasses were exclusively using spring and summer rain extracted from the uppermost soil layers. In contrast, trees were exclusively using groundwater, and the consistent delta(13)C values of tree leaves over the course of the summer indicated no seasonal changes in gas exchange and therefore minimal water stress in this life-form. Based on anecdotal rooting-depth Information and initial measurements of stem water delta(18)O, shrubs may have also had access to groundwater. However, their overall delta(18)O values indicated that they mainly used water from spring and summer precipitation events, extracted from subsurface soil layers. These findings indicate that the diversity of life-forms found in this shortgrass steppe community may be a function of the spatial partitioning of soil water resources, and their differential use by grasses, shrubs, and trees. Consequently, our findings support the two-layer model in a broad sense, but indicate a relatively flexible strategy of water acquisition by shrubs.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Wyoming, Dept Rangeland Ecol & Watershed Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Dodd, MB (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecosyst Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",doddm@agresearch.cri.nz,"Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013","Dodd, Michael/0000-0002-4159-4525",,,,47,130,167,3,68,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1998,117,4,,,,,504,512,,10.1007/s004420050686,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,157XF,WOS:000078086400007,28307675,,,,10/31/19J,"Rillig, MC; Allen, MF",,,,"Rillig, MC; Allen, MF",,,Arbuscular mycorrhizae of Gutierrezia sarothrae and elevated carbon dioxide: Evidence for shifts in C allocation to and within the mycobiont,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ATMOSPHERIC CO2; RHIZOSPHERE; RESPONSES; SOIL; COLONIZATION; ENRICHMENT; HYPHAE; FUNGI; ROOTS,"In a complete 2 x 2 factorial greenhouse experiment we examined the responses of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and non-mycorrhizal fungi to Gutierrezia sarothrae shrubs grown in elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (750 mu l l(-1)) and fertilized with N. AM percent infection did not change significantly with elevated CO2, but arbuscular infection increased 14-fold in the low-N treatment. Extraradical hyphal length increased on an absolute basis in elevated CO2, and also per infected root length. In the high-N treatments, increasing CO2 caused a decrease in hyphal length per infected root length, and an increase in vesicular infection. There was a significant positive response of AM infection intensity to increasing CO2 for the high N treatment, and a similar trend in the low N treatment. Infection intensity was positively correlated with arbuscular infection and with vesicular infection. Nonmycorrhizal fungi did not respond to any of the treatment combinations, as measured by percent root infection and external hyphal length.

Don plantation (42 degrees 52' S, 172 degrees 45' E) growing in a region subject to summer soil water deficit was investigated jointly with canopy assimilation (A(c)) and ecosystem-atmosphere C exchange rate (net ecosystem productivity, NEP). Net primary productivity was derived from biweekly stem diameter growth measurements using allometric relations, established after selective tree harvesting, and a litterfall model. Estimates of A(c) and NEP were used to drive a biochemically based and environmentally constrained model validated by seasonal eddy covariance measurements. Over three years with variable rainfall, NPP' varied between 8.8 and 10.6 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) whereas A(c) and NEP were 16.9 to 18.4 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 5.0-7.2 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. At the end of the grow ing season, C was mostly allocated to wood, with nearly half (47%) to stems and 27% to coarse roots. On an annual basis, the ratio of NEP to stand stem volume growth rate was 0.24 +/- 0.02 Mg C m(-3). The conservative nature of this ratio suggests that annual NEP can be estimated from forest yield tables. On a biweekly basis, NPP' repeatedly lagged A(c), suggesting the occurrence of intermediate C storage. Seasonal NPP'/A(c) thus varied between nearly zero and one. On an annual basis, however, NPP'/A(c) was 0.54 +/- 0.03, indicating a conservative allocation of C to autotrophic respiration. In the water-limited environment, variation in C sequestration rate was largely accounted for by a parameter integrative for changes in soil water content. The combination of mensurational data with canopy and ecosystem C fluxes yielded an estimate of heterotrophic respiration (NPP' - NEP) approximately 30% of NPP' and approximately 50% of NEP. The estimation of fine-root turnover rate is discussed.","Lincoln Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Lincoln, New Zealand; Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand","Arneth, A (reprint author), Landcare Res, POB 69, Lincoln, New Zealand.",,"Arneth, Almut/B-2702-2013",,,,,47,82,90,5,33,HERON PUBLISHING,VICTORIA,"202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA",0829-318X,,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,DEC,1998,18,12,,,,,785,793,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,137YX,WOS:000076945600001,12651399,,,,10/31/19J,"Gribaldo, S; Cammarano, P",,,,"Gribaldo, S; Cammarano, P",,,The root of the universal tree of life inferred from anciently duplicated genes encoding components of the protein-targeting machinery,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,tree of life; signal recognition particle (SRP); SRP receptor; gene duplication; last universal common ancestor; phylogeny,SIGNAL-RECOGNITION PARTICLE; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; EUKARYOTES; TOPOLOGIES; EVOLUTION; DOMAINS; ORIGIN; ATPASE,"The key protein of the signal recognition particle (termed SRP54 for Eucarya and Fm for Bacteria) and the protein (termed SR alpha for Eucarya and Ftsy for bacteria) involved in the recognition and binding of the ribosome SRP nascent polypeptide complex are the products of an ancient gene duplication that appears to predate the divergence of all extant taxa. The paralogy of the genes encoding the two proteins (both of which are GTP triphosphatases) is argued by obvious sequence similarities between the N-terminal half of SRP54(Ffh) and the C-terminal half of SRa(Ftsy). This enables a universal phylogeny based on either protein to be rooted using the second protein as an outgroup. Phylogenetic trees inferred by various methods from an alignment (220 amino acid positions) of the shared SRP54(Ffh) and SR alpha(Ftsy) regions generate two reciprocally rooted universal trees corresponding to the two genes. The root of both trees is firmly positioned between Bacteria and Archaea/Eucarya, thus providing strong support for the notion (Iwabe et al. 1989; Gogarten et al. 1989) that the first bifurcation in the tree of life separated the lineage leading to Bacteria from a common ancestor to Archaea and Eucarya. None of the gene trees inferred from the two paralogues support a paraphyletic Archaea with the crenarchaeota as a sister group to Eucarya.","Univ Rome La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biotecnol Cellulari & Ematol, Sez Genet Mol,Policlin Umberto 1, Ist Pasteur Fdn Cenci Bolognetti, I-00161 Rome, Italy","Cammarano, P (reprint author), Univ Rome La Sapienza, Dipartimento Biotecnol Cellulari & Ematol, Sez Genet Mol,Policlin Umberto 1, Ist Pasteur Fdn Cenci Bolognetti, Viale Regina Eleana 324, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",Cammarano@bce.med.uniroma1.it,,,,,,30,72,75,0,2,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0022-2844,,,J MOL EVOL,J.

Maximum leaf height was also significantly affected by light. Leaf height was similar in all treatments for the first ii weeks. For the last four weeks of the experiment, however, leaf height was lowest in plants grown in 0% shade, highest in plants grown in 63 and 90% shade, and intermediate in plants grown in 30% shade. Clipped plants tended to be taller than unclipped plants at lower levels of shade, while the opposite was true at higher levels of shade, although effects were marginally significant. Both light and the interactive effect of Light and clipping were important determinants of growth of S. ancistrochaetus in this experiment and therefore may be important influences on its distribution within and among pond habitats.","Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Mueller Lab 208, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Lentz, KA (reprint author), 5706 S Drexel Ave 3, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,35,38,40,0,14,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,NOV,1998,139,1,,,,,125,131,,10.1023/A:1009762603019,,,7,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,138DC,WOS:000076955300012,,,,,10/31/19J,"Wright, SF; Upadhyaya, A; Buyer, JS",,,,"Wright, SF; Upadhyaya, A; Buyer, JS",,,Comparison of N-linked oligosaccharides of glomalin from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and soils by capillary electrophoresis,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROTEIN,,"ARS, USDA, Soil Microbial Syst Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Univ Maryland, Dept Nat Resources & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Wright, SF (reprint author), ARS, USDA, Soil Microbial Syst Lab, Bldg 001,BARC-W, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",,,,,,,7,47,68,1,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0038-0717,,,SOIL BIOL BIOCHEM,Soil Biol.

Container-grown seedlings of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) were inoculated at seeding with ectomycorrhizal fungi having a high, moderate or low capacity to produce either IAA or ethylene in vitro. Inoculated seedlings were grown for one season in the nursery, harvested in November, cold stored over winter and then transplanted to either a nursery field or a forest site in the spring. Seedling morphology and endogenous IAA in roots were measured immediately after cold storage and again six and 12 months after transplanting. Morphological responses to inoculation varied among different mycorrhizal fungi. Free IAA concentration of roots was increased in some inoculation treatments for all conifer species. In seedlings transplanted to a nursery field, in vitro ethylene-producing capacity of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was highly correlated with more morphological features than in vitro IAA-producing capacity. Both IAA- and ethylene-producing capacity were significantly correlated with more morphological features in seedlings transplanted to a forest site than in seedings transplanted to a nursery field. One year after transplanting, only in vitro IAA-producing capacity was correlated with endogenous IAA concentration of roots of the inoculated seedlings. We conclude that growth responses of conifer seedlings can be partially influenced by IAA and ethylene produced by ectomycorrhizal fungal symbionts.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; ARS, USDA, Hort Crops Res Lab, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA","Scagel, CF (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Scagel, Carolyn/0000-0002-4269-6240",,,,48,7,10,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,NOV,1998,18,11,,,,,739,747,,,,,9,Forestry,Forestry,128JQ,WOS:000076403000003,12651408,,,,10/31/19J,"Staddon, PL; Fitter, AH",,,,"Staddon, PL; Fitter, AH",,,Does elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide affect arbuscular mycorrhizas?,TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,CO2 ENRICHMENT; BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; QUERCUS-ALBA; GROWTH; RESPONSES; SOIL; ROOT; COLONIZATION; INFECTION; SEEDLINGS,"It is well established that an increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 stimulates plant growth.

These species, belonging to the genera Acacia, Leucaena, Lysiloma, Prosopis and Pithecellobium, inhabit both primary and secondary tropical deciduous and thorn forests. The total length of the experiments was 165 days. At a variable frequency, the following four variables were measured: (1) relative growth rate (RGR), (2) root/shoot ratio (R/S), (3) root length/root dry weight ratio (RL/RDW), and (4) stem length (SL). The temporal behavior of these variables differed greatly among species. A direct relationship between seed weight and initial biomass production was initially found; however, the effect of seed size on biomass production was lost as plants aged. At the initial harvest, RGR values did not differ significantly among species, but they did at the end of the experiment; Pithecellobium dulce had the lowest final RGR. The three Acacia species had the highest biomass productions and highest R/S ratios but the lowest RL/RDW ratios; A. farnesiana and Lysiloma divaricata had the largest mean SL, whereas the smallest mean SL corresponded to the two Leucaena species and to Lysiloma acapulcensis. Several recommendations concerning the management of plants in the nursery and the optimal timing for transplanting the seedlings to reforestation sites are provided.

However, the effect of this biocide on nontarget organisms, including ectomycorrhizae, is uncertain. Following an initial assessment of organisms 2 years after application of the fumigant, a reassessment of the establishment of ectomycorrhizae on Douglas-fir seedlings was undertaken 4.5 and 5.5 years following chloropicrin application. Our findings show that in areas around stumps treated with 20% and 100% of the labeled dosage and in areas around non-treated stumps, chloropicrin did not adversely affect the formation of ectomycorrhizae on young Douglas-fir seedlings by naturally occurring fungi. No significant effect on the abundance or type of mycorrhizae were detected. On this site, chloropicrin did not affect these mycorrhizal associations, at least for 5 years following application.

The migratory nematodes (P. coffeae) reduced NO3- uptake rate by 56% and NH4+ uptake rate by 24% without affecting the proportion of fine roots per root system. Such lower NH4+ and NO3- uptake rates in the presence of nematodes are consistent with visual symptoms and foliar analyses indicating N deficiency in long-term field experiments with nematode-infected coffee plants. The nematode parasitic behaviors have a strong incidence on the mechanisms involved in the reduction of N uptake. The sedentary endoparasitic nematode (M. konaensis) decreased N uptake by a reduction of fine roots caused by gall formation without apparently affecting the uptake capacity of uninvaded fine root regions. The migratory endoparasitic nematode (P. coffeae) seemed to directly affect the root uptake capacity by damaging root cells during nematode penetration, exploration and feeding.

Much less attention has, however, been paid to the importance of maintaining an apoplastic calcium concentration which permits this mechanism to operate. Data are presented for the calcicole Leontodon hispidus, in which the xylem sap may contain over 16 mM free calcium, showing that the concentration of calcium in the guard cell apoplast may be as low as 0.10 mM. This appears to be achieved by the deposition of considerable amounts of calcium oxalate in the mesophyll, particularly in the palisade tissue. Of the calcium delivered directly into the epidermis by the transpiration stream, a large proportion is diverted into the trichomes. It seems unlikely that stomatal regulation over long distances (e.g. from root to shoot) is accomplished via apoplastic calcium, but over shorter distances (the span of a few cells in the epidermis) signalling via calcium in the apoplast is entirely feasible and it is worthy of further investigation.","Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Mansfield, TA (reprint author), Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",,,"Hetherington, Alistair/0000-0001-6060-9203",,,,34,12,15,0,0,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3263,,,Z PFLANZ BODENKUNDE,Z.

However, it is not known how rhizobia benefit from nodulating legume hosts because they fix nitrogen only after becoming bacteroids, which are terminally differentiated cells that cannot reproduce. Because undifferentiated rhizobia in and around the nodule can reproduce, evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation may depend upon kin selection. In some hosts, these kin may persist in the nodule as viable, undifferentiated bacteria. In other hosts, no viable rhizobia survive to reproduce after nodule senescence. Bacteroids in these hosts may benefit their free-living kin by enhancing production of plant root exudates. However, unrelated non-mutualists may also benefit from increased plant exudates. Rhizopines, compounds produced by bacteroids in nodules and catabolized only by related free-living rhizobia, may provide a mechanism by which bacteroids can preferentially benefit kin. Despite this apparent advantage, rhizopine genotypes are relatively rare. We constructed a mathematical model to examine how mixing within rhizobium populations influences the evolution of rhizopine genotypes. Our model predicts that the success of rhizopine genotypes is strongly dependent upon the spatial genetic structure of the bacterial population; rhizopine is more likely to dominate well-mixed populations. Further, for a given level of mixing, we find that rhizopine evolves under a positive frequency-dependent process in which stochastic accumulation of rhizopine alleles is necessary for rhizopine establishment. This process leads to increased spatial structure in rhizobium populations, and suggests that rhizopine may expand the conditions under which nitrogen fixation can evolve via kin selection.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Simms, EL (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",esim@midway.uchicago.edu,,,,,,49,17,19,0,8,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The goal of this study was to compare the effects of above- and below-ground competition of pasture grasses and shrubs on the growth of tree seedlings in abandoned tropical pasture in Costa Rica. Seedlings of Calophyllum brasiliense were planted in areas of dense pasture grass and below shrub patches. In each vegetation type seedlings were subjected to one of four treatments: control, root trenching, above-ground clearing, or trenching and clearing. Seedling height was measured and above- and below-ground biomass was harvested after one year. Seedling height and biomass were higher for seedlings grown under grass than under shrubs. Above-ground clearing had a strong positive effect an seedling height and all biomass measurements (stem, leaves, tap root, and fine roots). Trenching had a significant effect on height and all biomass measurements except tap root mass; however, trenching had a weaker effect on plant growth than above-ground clearing. Root:shoot ratios were significantly affected by trenching. These results suggest that both pasture grasses and early-colonizing shrubs may slow succession of forest in abandoned pasture. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of reducing above-ground competition to improve the success of reforestation efforts.

If ramets of a clonal plant are placed in conditions of high light and low water availability, and connected ramets are exposed to a low light and high water supply, they can reciprocally translocate water and assimilates. In addition, ramets in both patch types can adjust their root-shoot allocation in a way to increase the uptake of a locally abundant resource. Resource exchange and morphological specialization in the uptake of above- versus below-ground resources (analogous to a 'spatial division of labour' in economic systems) can considerably enhance the performance of clonal plants. A mathematical model is constructed to formalize the primary processes held responsible for the beneficial effects of a spatial division of labour in clonal plants. The model simulates water flow through a two-ramet system as function of environmental conditions, plant-related characteristics and finds the optimal root-shoot allocation for the two ramets. Optimality is defined as the total rate of photosynthesis of the two ramets. Simulations are run in spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. The model predictions suggest that interconnected ramets exposed to complementary patch types can maximise their performance by a functional specialization (i.e, plastic changes in root-shoot allocation) in the uptake of a locally abundant resource and by internally redistributing captured resources. This is in qualitative agreement with the results of experimental studies. The model outcome is largely determined by plant tissue conductivities for water transport, i.e. by root conductivity for water uptake, leaf conductivity for water loss and by internode conductivity for water sharing between ramets. The results of this study suggest a crucial role for the conductivity of stolen internodes in determining the degree of specialization and co-operation in clonal plants.

We hypothesized that the species composition of AMF communities could have the potential to determine plant community structure if the growth response to different AMF species or to communities of AMF species varies among plant species. To test the existence of such a differential response we conducted a pot experiment where each of three plant species, Hieracium pilosella, Bromus erectus, and Festuca ovina were inoculated with each of four AMF species, or with a mixture of these four AMF species, or were uninoculated. The AMF species originated from a calcareous grassland in which the three plant species also coexisted. We obtained three pieces of evidence suggesting that AMF have the potential to determine plant community structure. First, plant species differed in their dependency on AMF, thus varying in degree of benefit received. Second, specific AMF species and a mixture of these AMF species had significantly different effects on several plant growth variables, and these effects were not the same on each plant species. Third, the amount of variation in the growth response of a plant species to four AMF species and to the mixture of AMF species differed among the plant species. Hieracium differed greatly in its growth response to several AMF species while Bromus did not exhibit much variation in its response to different AMF species. The varying mycorrhizal dependency of different plant species has previously been proposed as a mechanism determining plant community structure. However, we found that the mycorrhizal dependency of a plant species can vary greatly because of differential growth responses to specific AMF species compared to the growth of the uninoculated plants. Consequently mycorrhizal dependency, as a measure indicating how much a plant depends on AMF for its growth, is not necessarily a fixed value and therefore cannot be used as a definitive term. In addition, those plant species with highly variable responses to single AMF species or to combinations of AMF species (AMF communities) will be strongly affected by the specific species of AMF that occupy their roots, in contrast to plant species that do not respond differently to different AMF species. We conclude that, through their differential effects on plant growth, AMF species that co-occur as natural AMF communities have the potential to determine plant community structure, and that future studies on plant population and community structure need to consider the strength of their role as a determinant.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Abt Pflanzenphysiol, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","van der Heijden, MGA (reprint author), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Abt Pflanzenphysiol, Hebelstr 1, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",,"van der Heijden, Marcel G.A./H-5243-2011; Boller, Thomas/G-3500-2012; Sanders, Ian/T-9988-2017","Boller, Thomas/0000-0001-6768-7503; Sanders, Ian/0000-0002-9591-8214",,,,44,469,499,4,243,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",Dec-58,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,1998,79,6,,,,,2082,2091,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2082:DAMFSA]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,116YM,WOS:000075752700019,,,,,10/31/19J,"Steltzer, H; Bowman, WD",,,,"Steltzer, H; Bowman, WD",,,Differential influence of plant species on soil nitrogen transformations within moist meadow Alpine tundra,ECOSYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,plant species effects; net nitrogen mineralization; net nitrification; alpine tundra; phenolics; carbon : nitrogen ratio; fine-root production,LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION; ORGANIC-MATTER; FINE ROOTS; MINERALIZATION; CARBON; DYNAMICS; COMMUNITIES; TEMPERATURE; ECOSYSTEMS; AVAILABILITY,"Plant species can influence nitrogen (N) cycling indirectly through the feedbacks of litter quality and quantity on soil N transformation rates. The goal of this research was to focus on small-scale (within-community) variation in soil N cycling associated with two community dominants of the moist meadow alpine tundra. Within this community the small-scale patchiness of the two most abundant species (Acomastylis rossii and Deschampsia caespitosa) provides natural variation in species cover within a relatively similar microclimate, thus enabling estimation of the effects of plant species on soil N transformation rates. Monthly rates of soil N transformalions were dependent on small-scale variation in both soil microclimate and species cover. The relative importance of species cover compared with soil microclimate increased for months 2 and 3 of the 3-month growing season. Growing-season net N mineralization rates were over ten times greater and nitrification rates were four times greater in Deschampsia patches than in Acomastylis patches. Variability in litter quality [carbon:nitrogen (C:N) and phenolic:N], litter quantity (aboveground and fine-root production), and soil quality (C:N) was associated with three principal components. Variability between the species in litter quality and fine-root Production explained 31% of the variation in net N mineralization rates and 36% of net nitrification rates. Site variability across the landscape in aboveground production and soil C:N explained 33% of the variation in net N mineralization rates and 21% of net nitrification rates. Within the moist meadow community the high spatial variability in soil N transformation rates was associated with differences in the dominant species' litter quality and fine-root production. Deschampsia-dominated patches consistently had greater soil N transformation rates than did Acomastylis-dominated patches across the landscape, despite site variability in soil moisture, soil C:N, and aboveground production. Plant species appear to be an important control of soil N transformation in the alpine tundra, and consequently may influence plant community structure and ecosystem function.","Univ Colorado, Mt Res Stn, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Steltzer, H (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Mt Res Stn, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Campus Box 334, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",steltzer@samiam.colorado.edu,,,,,,47,76,82,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,SEP-OCT,1998,1,5,,,,,464,474,,10.1007/s100219900042,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,134NZ,WOS:000076750600009,,,,,10/31/19J,"de Bie, S; Ketner, P; Paasse, M; Geerling, C",,,,"de Bie, S; Ketner, P; Paasse, M; Geerling, C",,,Woody plant phenology in the West Africa savanna,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,phenology; West Africa; savanna; woody plants,TANZANIA,"In the savanna of West Africa the seasonality of rainfall, with a drought period of at least four months, strongly influences the vegetation. Rainfall is a very critical abiotic variable and therefore plant species must be well adapted to survive in this habitat. In our research, phenological patterns of 120 woody plant species have been examined based on the presence of green leaves. According to the patterns found, these species can be classified in phenological groups, which represent different strategies for survival. Two extreme strategies are found to resist drought: (1) by using the waterstorage in the deeper soil layers and river beds and by restrictings drought-damage through scleromorphic features, and (2) by avoiding the drought through foliage shedding in the dry period. The first strategy is represented by the riparian and upland evergreens, and the semi-evergreens. The evergreens bear leaves the whole year, gradually replacing old leaves by new ones. The riparian evergreens are strictly bound to riverbeds and grow in or immediately adjacent to them. The semi-evergreens shed their leaves and start sprouting during a short period (one-two weeks) once a year. Because the evergreens and the semi-evergreens are in leaf in the dry period they have to protect themselves to drought damage by scleromorphic features. Contrary to these species are the deciduous species which are bare for at least some months per year. When the dry season starts their leaves dry out and are subsequently shed. They start sprouting before or at the beginning of the first rains. Although much less in number, some deciduous trees also have scleromorphic features to resist drought-damage. The strategy of sprouting just before the rainy season begins indicates that certain water resources remain available to these deep-rooting woody plants throughout the year, providing them with a fully operating photosynthetic apparatus when favourable conditions arrive.","Agr Univ Wageningen, Dept Terr Ecol & Nat Conservat, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands","de Bie, S (reprint author), Netherlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, Environm Safety & Arbo Div, POB 28000, NL-9400 HH Assen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,28,73,74,3,20,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Swezey] is a native cool-season grass that has been observed to invade rangelands dominated by the weedy annual grasses, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and medusahead wildrye [Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski]. Our objective was to determine if growth characteristics could account for this squirreltail trait. We used growth analysis to examine differences in seedling growth and tissue allocation of 5 squirreltail entries, 2 long-lived perennial grasses ('Goldar' bluebunch wheatgrass [Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love] and 'Hycrest' crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult. XA. cristatum (L.) Gaertn.]), cheatgrass, and medusahead wildrye. We monitored the 9 entries in a greenhouse for mean relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio, root relative growth rate, specific root length, root-to-shoot dry-mass ratio, and root length-to-leaf area ratio beginning 10 days after solving at 9 destructive harvests at 3-day intervals. Cheatgrass had high relative growth rate for both shoot and root. Only medusahead wildrye equalled the shoot relative growth rate of cheatgrass, and only Hycrest equalled its root relative growth rate. Cheatgrass seedlings were larger than squirreltail seedlings by 2 to 3 weeks after emergence. Few differences were detected among perennials and medusahead wildrye. Cheatgrass displayed the highest leaf area ratio and specific leaf area of the 9 entries but was similar to medusahead wildrye and Red Deer River squirreltail for specific root length. Growth characteristics cannot account for squirreltail's observed ability to invade annual grass stands. However, the combination of high specific leaf area and specific root length in squirreltail germplasm, as found in cheatgrass, may enhance squirreltail survival under competition with annual grasses, especially medusahead wildrye.","Utah State Univ, Dept Rangeland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Forage & Range Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,,"Arredondo Moreno, Jose/A-9972-2015","Arredondo Moreno, Jose/0000-0003-1969-9942",,,,45,75,78,1,22,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

We assessed leaf delta(15)N as a presumptive indicator of symbiotic N-2 fixation, and leaf and wood cellulose delta(13)C as an indicator of leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (CO assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) in dominant trees of 21 species selected for their representativeness in the forest cover, their ecological strategy (pioneers or late successional stage species, shade tolerance) or their potential ability for N-2 fixation. Similar measurements were made in trees of native species growing in a nearby plantation after severe perturbation (clear cutting, mechanical soil disturbance). Bulk soil delta(15)N was spatially quite uniform in the forest (range 3-5%), whereas average leaf delta(15)N ranged from -0.3% to 3.5% in the different species. Three species only, Diplotropis purpurea, Recordoxylon speciosum (Fabaceae), and sclerolobium melinonii (Caesalpiniaceae), had root bacterial nodules, which was also associated with leaf N concentrations higher than 20 mg g(-1). Although nodulated trees displayed significantly lower leaf delta(15)N values than non-nodulated trees. leaf delta(15)N did not prove a straightforward indicator of symbiotic fixation, since there was a clear overlap of delta(15)N values for nodulated and non-nodulated species at the lower end of the delta(15)N range. Perturbation did not markedly affect the difference delta(15)N(soil) - delta(15)N(leaf), and thus the isotopic data provide no evidence of an alteration in the different N acquisition patterns. Extremely large interspecific differences in sunlit leaf delta(13)C were observed in the forest (average values from -31.4 to -26.7%), corresponding to intrinsic water-use efficiencies (ratio CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) varying over a threefold range. Wood cellulose delta(13)C was positively related to total leaf delta(13)C. the former values being 2-3% higher than the latter ones. Leaf delta(13)C was not related to leaf delta(15)N at either intraspecific or interspecific levels. delta(13)C of sunlit leaves was highest in shade hemitolerant emergent species and was lower in heliophilic, but also in shade-tolerant species. For a given species, leaf delta(13)C did not differ between the pristine forest and the disturbed plantation conditions. Our results are not in accord with the concept of existence of functional types of species characterized by common suites of traits underlying niche differentiation; rather, they support the hypothesis that each trait leads to a separate grouping of species.","INRA, Equipe Bioclimatol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, F-54280 Seichamps, France; Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Microbienne Sol, CNRS, UMR 5557, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; INRA, Stn Rech Forestieres, Silvolab Guyane, F-97387 Kourou, France; Echangeur Solaize, CNRS, Serv Cent Anal, F-60390 Vernaison, France; Univ Paris 06, Ctr Rech Geodynam, F-74203 Thonon Les Bains, France; INRA, Equipe Microbiol Forestiere, F-54280 Champenoux, France","Guehl, JM (reprint author), INRA, Equipe Bioclimatol & Ecophysiol Forestiere, F-54280 Seichamps, France.",guehl@nancy.inra.fr,,,,,,86,61,67,6,33,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1998,116,3,,,,,316,330,,10.1007/s004420050593,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,121VD,WOS:000076034600003,28308062,,,,10/31/19J,"Parsons, WFJ; Ehrenfeld, JG; Handel, SN",,,,"Parsons, WFJ; Ehrenfeld, JG; Handel, SN",,,Vertical growth and mycorrhizal infection of woody plant roots as potential limits to the restoration of woodlands on landfills,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECTOMYCORRHIZA FORMATION; SOUTHWEST OREGON; CLEAR-CUTS; SOIL; SURVIVAL; FUNGI; SEEDLINGS,"We assessed the vertical growth and mycorrhizal infection of woody plant roots on a closed landfill, using tree and shrub clusters that had been previously installed in patches of increasing size to establish protocols for woodland restoration. The density of the fine roots of shrubs, which had poor-to-moderate mycorrhizal infection, decreased strongly with increasing depth. Oak (Quercus) seedlings planted within and outside patches were assessed for ectomycorrhizal infection. Oak root systems were mycorrhizal, but root-tip proliferation was improved and ectomycorrhizal composition was influenced by woody debris in the mineral soil. Most surviving oaks were found within patches, but all seedlings showed poor growth: most taproots were deflected horizontally above the boundary between surface soil and subsoil layers (greater than or equal to-15 cm). Abrupt decreases in pH between surface and subsurface horizons (6.9 versus 5.3), together with poor drainage and aeration of the latter soil, were probably responsible for poor root growth. Root growth of greenhouse-grown pine and maple seedlings was similarly restricted in pots packed with top-soil over subsoil material. Our results suggest that many current specifications for the cover of closed landfills will not permit restoration of native woody plant communities because of physical limitations to root growth and infectivity. The structure of the engineered soil must address basic plant growth requirements as well as traditional concerns of drainage and barrier protection.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA","Parsons, WFJ (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",,,,,,,35,10,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Hull). Plants were pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-14 at ambient and elevated CO2 and two nitrogen regimes (low and high). After harvesting the plants, the soil was incubated to monitor total respiration and decomposition of C-14-labeled rhizodeposits. Total and shoot biomass increased at high N but were not affected by CO2. Root biomass was not affected by either N or CO2 treatments. Total C-14 uptake and shoot-C-14 increased upon adding N and elevating CO2 but the N effect was strongest. Total C-14 uptake per unit shoot mass decreased with N, but increased with CO2. Root-C-14 content was not significantly affected by the N or CO2 treatment. Total soil-C-14 slightly increased at elevated CO2 whereas microbial C-14 increased due to high N. C allocation to shoots increased at the expense of roots, soil and respiration at high N but was not affected by the CO2 treatment. Variation in C-14 distribution within each treatment was small compared to variation in total C-14 amounts in each plant-soil compartment. Initially, C-14 respiration from rhizodeposits correlated well with root-C-14, total soil-C-14, soil solution-C-14 and microbial C-14, at harvest time and was increased by elevated CO2. By the end of the incubation, however, decomposition of labeled organic matter was not affected by the treatments whereas total (=C-12+C-14) respiration was lowest for the elevated-CO2 soils. We speculate that initially, respiration is dominated by decomposition of fresh root exudates whereas in the longer term, respiration originates from decomposition of more recalcitrant root material that had been formed during the entire experiment. The increased net C-14 uptake and unchanged distribution pattern, combined with an increased decomposition of easily-decomposable compounds and a decreased decomposition of more recalcitrant root-derived material indicated a small sink function of a Calluna plant-soil system under elevated CO2.

Bacteria were initially released from rhizosphere soil using homogenisation and centrifugation before adding the labelled substrates. The incorporation rate for both thymidine and leucine was higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. This was due both to higher bacterial numbers and higher cell-specific incorporation rates for rhizosphere bacteria compared with bulk soil. The rhizosphere-to-soil ratio (R/S) was slightly higher for the thymidine than for the leucine incorporation rate. The total incorporation rate, the cell-specific incorporation rate and bacterial numbers increased in the rhizosphere with time during a 2-week growth period of the seedlings, while all these variables were constant in the bulk soil. The R/S ratio of the percentage culturable bacteria increased 4-fold during this 2-week period. When comparing incorporation into rhizosphere bacterial communities from zones at different distances from the root tip, the incorporation rate and the cell-specific incorporation rate of both thymidine and leucine increased with distance from the root tip, irrespective of the seedling age (4 to 8 d). The thymidine and leucine incorporation techniques thus did not only differentiate between bacterial activity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, but were also sensitive enough to allow studies along the root.

Using NO(3)(-) of known delta(15)N the proportions of plant N derived from NO(3)(-) and N(2) were determined. Total N accumulated in the +NO(3)(-) treatment inoculated with WU95 was close to the average of that of the 9 soil-based inocula, but this Rhizobium performed poorly in the minus N treatment (viz. 67 for WU95 versus a mean of 81 mg N plant(-1) for soil inocula). Some inocula, including WU95, proved to be relatively tolerant of early season NO(3)(-), with fixation in +NO(3)(-) treatments up to 80% of those of corresponding minus N cultures. In other associations fixation under +NO(3)(-) treatment was less than half that of matching minus N plants. Highly variable performances were recorded between associations in respect of nodule number, mean nodule size, nodule biomass per plant and nodule fixation rate. Several instances were recorded where total N accumulations in the presence of nitrate were more than 30% less than that of fully symbiotic plants. The reasons for variation in nodulation and N(2) fixation under early season NO(3)(-) are not clear, but suggest complex Rhizobium-directed influences shaping host plant response. The possibility of selecting NOS tolerant rhizobia as alternative inoculants, for situations in which early season nitrate availability is restrictive to nodulation, is discussed.

We studied fine-root (less than or equal to 1.0 mm diameter) respiration in four sugar maple forests for three growing seasons in order to assess the combined effects of temperature, N concentration, and soil moisture on respiration rates. Fine-root respiration at the four sites was exponentially related to soil temperature and linearly related to root N concentration and soil moisture availability. Most of the variability in respiration rates was explained by temperature. Differences in soil moisture availability explained temporal variation within sites in respiration rate at a given temperature, whereas differences among sites in respiration rates resulted from site-specific differences in fine-root N concentration. Periodic moisture deficits during 1995 and 1996 were sufficient to cause declines of up to 17% in total growing-season root respiration at affected sites. Estimated reductions in respiration of up to 0.8 Mg C/ha during dry years were equivalent to a significant portion of annual aboveground woody biomass C increment, arguing for the inclusion of soil moisture availability as a predictor of root respiration when modeling C allocation in forest ecosystems.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Burton, AJ (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry & Wood Prod, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",,"Zak, Donald/C-6004-2012","Burton, Andrew/0000-0002-3068-0997; Zak, Donald/0000-0002-9730-7337",,,,51,106,125,2,43,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Some allometric traits can change with plant size. The present study compared crown and trunk allometries, root/shoot biomass allometry, and root architecture among understory saplings (0.25-5 m height, except for two trees > 5 < 7 m) of seven deciduous dicotyledonous species in central Japan. Associations of the crown and trunk allometries with several plant morphological attributes were analyzed. Branch morphology (plagiotropy vs orthotropy) and life size were correlated with sapling crown and trunk allometries. Both large leaves and orthotropic branches were associated with a narrow small crown and slender trunk. The root/shoot ratio decreased rapidly with increasing plant height for saplings shorter than about 1.5 m. Less shade-tolerant species tended to have smaller root/shoot ratios for saplings taller than 1.5 m. With an increase in plant height, the branch/trunk biomass ratio decreased for saplings with plagiotropic branches but increased for saplings with orthotropic branches. Four subcanopy species (Acer distylum, Carpinus cordata, Fraxinus lanuginosa and Acanthopanax sciadophylloides) had superficial root systems; a common understory species (Sapium japonica) had a deep tap root system; and a canopy species (Magnolia obovata) and a subcanopy species (Acer tenuifolium) had heart root systems of intermediate depth. The root depth was not related to shade tolerance, Among species of the same height, the difference in fine root length can be 30-fold.","Utsunomiya Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Forest Sci, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 321, Japan","Cao, KF (reprint author), Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Tungku BE 1410, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.",,"Cao, Kun-Fang/D-2157-2009","Cao, Kun-Fang/0000-0002-2253-7189",,,,44,22,28,1,37,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

(Phaseolus) increased (on average for two cultivars) the herbage mass by 46.6 +/- 6.0%, seed mass by 39.2 +/- 3.6%, mass of 1000 seeds by 16.0 +/- 0.8%, nitrogen content in seeds by 58.3 +/- 8.9%, starch content in seeds by 30.0 +/- 5.5% and number of nodules by 254%. Inoculation with this strain produced the same herbage (seed) mass as NH4NO3 application (120 kg ha(-1) of N), while the combined treatment of rhizobia and 60 kg ha(-1) of N produced significantly higher yields than rhizobia inoculation alone or application of 120 kg ha(-1) of N. The rhizobia strain M11 was isolated from Uzbekistan soils and significantly exceeded the commercial strain CIAM1901 in its influence on herbage mass by 3.9-10.6%. Two factor analysis of variance demonstrated that the herbage mass and number of nodules are controlled mainly by the rhizobia strain genotypes, while seed yield, number of pods, mass of 1000 seeds and N and starch content in seeds are influenced by the plant cultivar genotypes.
